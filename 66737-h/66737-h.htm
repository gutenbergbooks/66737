</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE blacksmith&#8217;s forge stood just this side of the village
as you entered it from Shepston, and David
Blake, the smith, was blowing lustily at his bellows, while
the sweat dripped down his face. The cool of a spring
morning came through the doorway, against which leaned
a heavy, slouching lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he, David the Smith! Sparks do go scrambling up
chimney,&#8221; said Billy the Fool, with a fat and empty laugh.</p>

<p>They called him Billy the Fool, for old affection&#8217;s sake,
with no sense of reproach; for the old ways of thought had
a fast hold on Garth village, and a natural was held
in a certain awe, as being something midway between a
prophet and a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, sparks are scrambling up. &#8217;Tis a way they have,
Billy,&#8221; answered the other cheerily. &#8220;What&#8217;s your
news?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Billy laughed, but cunningly this time. &#8220;Grand
news&mdash;all about myself. Was up at sunrise, and been
<i>doing naught</i> ever since. I&#8217;m main fond of doing naught,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
David. Seems to trickle down your body, does idleness,
like good ale.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blacksmith loosed his hold on the bellows&#8217; handles
and turned about, while he passed a hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nought ye like better than idleness?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Think now, Billy&mdash;just ponder over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; answered the other, after a silence,
&#8220;there&#8217;s playing&mdash;what ye might call playing at a right
good game. Could ye think of some likely pastime,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, could I. Blowing bellows is the grandest frolic
ever I came across.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was wary, after his own fashion, and he looked
at the blacksmith hard, his child&#8217;s eyes&mdash;blue and unclouded
by the storms of life&mdash;showing big beneath their
heavy brows of reddish-brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt &#8217;tis work, David,&#8221; he said dispassionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, now! Would I ask <i>thee</i> to work, lad? Fond o&#8217;
thee as I am, and knowing labour&#8217;s harmful to thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to be trapped into work. &#8217;Twould
scare me when I woke o&#8217; nights and thought of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See ye, then, Billy&#8221;&mdash;blowing the bellows gently&mdash;&#8220;is
it work to make yon sparks go, blue and green and red,
as fast as ever ye like to drive &#8217;em? Play, I call it, and
I&#8217;ve a mind, now I come to think on&#8217;t, just to keep ye out
o&#8217; the game, and go on playing it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy drew nearer, with an anxious look. &#8220;Ye wouldn&#8217;t
do that, or ye&#8217;d not be blacksmith David,&#8221; he said, with
unerring knowledge of the other&#8217;s kindliness. &#8220;Te-he!
&#8217;Tis just a bit o&#8217; sporting&mdash;I hadn&#8217;t thought of it i&#8217; that
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>And soon he was blowing steadily; for the lad&#8217;s frame
was a giant&#8217;s, when he chose to use it, and no fatigue had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
ever greatly touched him. From time to time, as the
blacksmith paused to take a red-hot bar from the furnace
or to put a cold one in, he would nod cheerfully at Billy
the Fool and emphasize the frolicsome side of his employment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve an easy time, Billy,&#8221; he would say. &#8220;See me
sweating here at beating iron into horseshoe shape&mdash;and
ye playing at chasing sparks all up the chimley!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sweat was pouring from Billy, too, by this time,
but he did not heed. Plump and soft his laugh came, as
he forced the sparks more swiftly from the coals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was born for playtimes, I, David,&#8221; he cried in great
delight. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard tell of silver spoons, popped unbeknownst-like
into babbies&#8217; cradles. <i>I</i> war a babby o&#8217;
that make, I reckon, for sure &#8217;tis I&#8217;m always playing,
when I&#8217;m not always idling in between times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye were lucky fro&#8217; birth,&#8221; David answered, driving
the hole for the last nail. &#8220;Some folk is, while other-some
must work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>do</i> ye work, David?&#8221; asked the other, with entire
simplicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just a fancy, lad. Seems as I have to, somehow.
There were no silver spoons dropped into <i>my</i> cradle.
Hive o&#8217; bees swarmed there, I fancy, for I&#8217;ve had a few
in my bonnet ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another silence, while Billy the Fool, working
hard at the bellows, looked long and meditatively at David
Blake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t like to hurt ye, David,&#8221; he said at
last, &#8220;but I reckon ye&#8217;re just a bit daft-witted like.
Why don&#8217;t ye play or idle all your time, same as I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>David threw the finished horseshoe on the heap at his
left hand, and was about to answer when a shadow came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
between the reeking smithy and the fresh and open sunshine
beyond the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;tis ye, Priscilla?&#8221; he said, looking up. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve
got the spring-look in your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she stood half in, half out of the smithy door, Priscilla
was radiant in her young and pliant beauty. To David
Blake&#8217;s fancy&mdash;rough, kindly, not far wide of the mark
at any time&mdash;she &#8220;made the day new-washed and happier&#8221;;
yet it was Billy who next found his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he! Ye look as if life was playtime for ye, too,&#8221;
said he, still blowing at his bellows, but looking at her
slily over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; she laughed&mdash;and the kind, wise music
of the thrush was in her laughter. &#8220;&#8217;Tis very true, Billy.
Life&#8217;s playtime for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Blake looked at her, and liked her a little the
better; for he knew that Priscilla worked hard, worked
long and with a blithe face, each day of her life. To the
blacksmith it seemed, in between doing odd jobs that
brought him in a livelihood, that his prime work in life
was to love Priscilla ever and ever a little more&mdash;and
each day to find himself more tongue-tied in her presence.</p>

<p>Again it was Billy who took up the talk, though Blake
would think to-morrow of twenty things he might have
said, and curse himself in a quiet way for having failed
to say them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always playing, as a man might say, myself,&#8221;
chuckled the Fool. &#8220;Playing at bellows-blowing now.
See the lile sparks go up, Miss Priscilla&mdash;&#8217;tis I that send
them, right enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she said, nodding pleasantly at his wide
and gaping face. &#8220;We&#8217;re playing, Billy, you and I. Only
the blacksmith works.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bit of a fool, by that token,&#8221; hazarded Billy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>The blacksmith, when he laughed at all, laughed from
his lungs outward. &#8220;Always guessed it, Priscilla,&#8221; said
he, making his anvil ring. &#8220;Billy&#8217;s a child, but old in
wisdom. Bit of a fool I&#8217;ll be to the end, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m playing, David,&#8221; said Billy, while the blacksmith
halted in his work to steal a glance at Priscilla. &#8220;Get
ye on with your work o&#8217; making horseshoes, if I&#8217;m playing
the tune to ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again David laughed. &#8220;Keeps me at it, Priscilla,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Never met a taskmaster so hard to drive a man
as Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want ye at Good Intent,&#8221; said Priscilla, laughing
too&mdash;and her laughter was a pleasant thing to hear,
reminding David again of throstles when the spring comes
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can ease your hold of the bellows, Billy,&#8221; said
David, with an alacrity that was patent to the girl, modest
and proud as she was. &#8220;When I am called to Good Intent
Farm&mdash;well, I go, most times, and ne&#8217;er ask what&#8217;s
wanted, and leave smithy-work behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robbing me o&#8217; my playtime,&#8221; panted Billy the Fool,
as he mopped his forehead.</p>

<p>He looked up at David, and his blue eyes were wistful
as a dog&#8217;s asking for commands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll be idle now,&#8221; said the blacksmith. &#8220;Play
first, laddie, and idleness after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, you&#8217;re right,&mdash;you&#8217;re always right, saving odd
times, when you&#8217;re a Fool Billy like myself. Miss Priscilla
has a trick o&#8217; making ye daft-witted, I&#8217;ve noticed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The village natural, with his huge body and his big,
child&#8217;s eyes, had a way of finding out his neighbours&#8217;
secrets, and had no shame at all in telling folk what each
wanted to hide from the other. Priscilla turned her face
away, and David reddened like a lovesick lad.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>&#8220;Keep the forge-fire going quietly,&#8221; said the blacksmith.
&#8220;That&#8217;s idleness for ye&mdash;just to lie dreaming
this side of it, and time and time to put the fuel on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, that&#8217;s idleness,&#8221; said Billy, as he stretched himself&mdash;again
like a shaggy, trusty dog&mdash;along the smithy floor.
&#8220;Get ye to work, David, and leave me to my play-work.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went out into the springtime, David and Priscilla,
and the breeze was cool and sweet about them as if
it blew from beds of primroses. The lass wished that
David Blake had more to say, wished that the quickness
of the spring would run off his tongue&#8217;s end; she did not
know that he felt it&mdash;more than she, maybe&mdash;but had
no words in which to tell her of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a body thoughtless-like, Priscilla,&#8221; he said
at last. &#8220;Never asked ye what the job was I was wanted
for; and here I am without a tool to my back.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was able to do so many jobs, and do them handily,
that it might be one of twenty that was asked of him to-day,
and he looked anxiously at Priscilla, to ask if he
should go back for his tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was watching the water-wagtails,&#8221; she answered,
scarcely hearing him. &#8220;They&#8217;re home to the old stream
again, David, and that means the spring is here, or hereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched the pair of mating birds sit, first on the low
stone wall that guarded the stream, then flicker to the road,
their white tails moving like a lady&#8217;s fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mating-time, Priscilla,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Something in his voice, something in the true, quiet
ring of it moved Priscilla strangely.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re bonnie birds, David,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Winter&#8217;s
out, and springtime&#8217;s coming in, when they wag their
trim, white tails.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>&#8220;Ay, true. But what tools ought I to have brought,
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla sighed, for dull-wittedness did not commend
itself to-day. &#8220;No tools at all, David. The roan cow
I&#8217;m so fond of has lodged a slice of turnip in her throat,
and father cannot move it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy as falling out of a tree, Priscilla. Lord, I thought
you farmer-folk knew somewhat&mdash;but when it comes to
a cow, ye&#8217;ve got to whistle for David the Smith!&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla glanced at him with a roguery as dainty and
secure as that of the spring itself. &#8220;They say ye can talk
to the four-footed things, David, and make them understand
ye. Pity ye can&#8217;t spare more words for us poor
two-footed folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but the beasts are sensible, somehow, lass. They
don&#8217;t maze ye up with words and what ye might call the
frills and furbelows o&#8217; life&mdash;they just look at ye, and feel
your hands going smooth and quiet down their flanks,
<i>and they know</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy has that sort of instinct, I have noticed,&#8221; said
Priscilla demurely. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a dog in the countryside
that won&#8217;t come and fawn on him&mdash;though some
of our dogs are not just gentle.&#8221;</p>

<p>David gave another of his great, hearty laughs. &#8220;My
father always said, when he was alive, that I&#8217;d been
intended for a natural, and missed it only by good luck.
I&#8217;m fond of Billy the Fool myself; simple and slow is
Billy, and what he lacks in wit he makes up for in heart-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, David,&#8221; said the girl, a little daunted,
as she often was, by David&#8217;s settled outlook upon things.</p>

<p>For herself, there were times when she longed to cross
the limits of this life at Garth, longed for the romance of
the beyond; but when David talked as he was talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
now she felt shamefacedly that he was in the right to be
content within the boundaries of the fields and the blithe,
raking hills, the village smithy and the village farmsteads.</p>

<p>David Blake did not belie his reputation when, after
following the wood-path through the Ghyll, they came
to Good Intent&mdash;a grey and well-found homestead&mdash;and
sought the mistals. What with surgeon&#8217;s skill and
the skill that comes from utter friendship with all cattle,
he did what neither Priscilla nor her father could have
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you thanks, David,&#8221; said Farmer Hirst, a broad,
well-timbered man, with a voice like thunder on the distant
hills. &#8220;She&#8217;s the pick of the lot, this roan ye&#8217;ve
saved, and saving&#8217;s saving, whether it is your child or
your cow that&#8217;s ailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now!&#8221; murmured the blacksmith, &#8220;there&#8217;s joy
in saving beasties, and no thanks needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thanks are waiting for ye when ye care to pick
&#8217;em up&mdash;which ye seldom do, David&mdash;and meanwhile
I&#8217;ve to see if my men are cutting the thorn-hedge to my
liking. Priscilla, there&#8217;s cake and ale within doors; there&#8217;s
one in Garth can look better to David&#8217;s needs than ever
I could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now David&#8217;s laugh was hearty; but it was a child&#8217;s
whisper when compared with Farmer Hirst&#8217;s, especially
when the older man fancied that he was using rare diplomacy.
A true yeoman of the north was this master of
Good Intent&mdash;owned his own house and land, his own
quiet, wholesome pride, his line of goodly forbears. And
so, because he had learned to know a man when he saw
him, he had long ago chosen David as the favoured suitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lasses must wed, leaving their fathers lonely,&#8221; the
farmer would say to himself as he sat o&#8217; nights&mdash;Priscilla
gone to bed&mdash;and drank his nightcap of hot rum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;d have felt less lonesome-like if Priscilla&#8217;s mother wasn&#8217;t
lying green under sod, and me alone save for Cilla. But
lasses must wed, and I&#8217;ve seen o&#8217; late the mating look in
Priscilla&#8217;s face. Well, her mother wore that look, once on
a day, and I&#8217;ve seen no better in my long life, and never
shall. It must be David&mdash;oh, ay, it must be David!&#8221;</p>

<p>So he left them together this morning, and his big voice
seemed to echo up and down the grey, stone hills long
after he had left.</p>

<p>Farmer Hirst had given the blacksmith many chances
of this kind; and always it had been, as now, the signal
for David to grow tongue-tied, for Priscilla to show the
wild-rose flag of maidenly rebellion in her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis kindly, this smell of a mistal,&#8221; ventured David
by and by. &#8220;Sweet o&#8217; the kine, I call it&mdash;&#8217;tis so lusty and
so big to smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla answered nothing. There&#8217;s something in the
fragrance at a cattle-byre that makes for wooing, no man
can tell you why; and the lass was young and was feeling
two spring seasons meet in her&mdash;spring of her untried
youth, and spring of the tried old world that knows its
faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla, the throstles are singing out-of-doors,&#8221; said he,
bending an ear toward the open fields.</p>

<p>His meaning should have been clear; for, when a
throstle sings across the reek of an open mistal-door, the
human oddities of speech should be altogether lost, and
the world&#8217;s tongue interpret all. Yet Priscilla missed it,
and disdained the thrush&#8217;s clarion note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, David, and the world is turning round about the
sun, and the stars come out o&#8217; nights, and I&#8217;ve to do my
churning by and by. David, is there naught beyond your
throstles and your stars and the sun that guides the
world?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Naught,&#8221; answered David stolidly. &#8220;They&#8217;re life,
Priscilla, and maybe when we&#8217;re hid beneath the sward
we&#8217;ll know of bonnier things&mdash;but not just yet, I&#8217;m
thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was David&#8217;s moment, had he known it. It needed
a touch, a glance, a right word spoken that should ring in
tune with the spring; and while he halted there came a
sound of whistling all across the mistal-yard. It was not
like Farmer Hirst to turn back when once he had set off,
and Priscilla wondered whose the footstep could be&mdash;the
step that was quicker and lighter than her father&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the farm-men, maybe,&#8221; muttered David, remembering,
now that the opportunity was like to be lost,
the one right speech he should have whispered into Priscilla&#8217;s
ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;nor yet father&#8217;s. &#8217;Tis a town-bred step, David.
Cannot you hear the mincing tread, as if he thought the
sweet yard-litter could hurt a body&#8217;s feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, now you name it, so I can. Treads nipperty-like,
as a cat does. Mistrust that sort of going, I. Who can he
be, Priscilla?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some stranger likely. Some one that&#8217;s never smelled
the warmth of a cattle-byre, so I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The footsteps sounded near and hurried now, but still
there was that delicate, lady-like treading across what
Priscilla had named the sweet yard-litter. David and the
girl, looking from the shadows of the mistal into the open
sunlight, saw a well-dressed figure of a man&mdash;a man
neither short nor tall, neither dark nor fair&mdash;a man
no way remarkable, unless the sun was full upon him,
and, seeing him from a shadowed place, you noted the
uncertain eyes which long ago had been a puzzle to his
mother when he stood beside her knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no one at Good Intent, except old Martha,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
said the newcomer, lifting his hat with an air which David
Blake could not have copied had Priscilla&#8217;s love depended
on it. &#8220;She told me you were here&mdash;&#8216;likely,&#8217; she added,
in the queer speech I used to know, &#8216;seeing the roan cow
was sick, and you were tending her.&#8217; Priscilla, surely
you&#8217;ve not forgotten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>David Blake was the best-tempered man in all the long
vale of Strathgarth, so folk said; but there were times
when he was as ill to meet, as ill to look at, as if he had
been a north-born dog, guarding a north-built threshold
from a stranger he distrusted. And David listened to
this prit-a-prat man who tried to mimick old Martha&#8217;s
wholesome speech; and Priscilla, glancing sideways
at the man who should have wooed her in the mistal&mdash;as
women will glance toward a known lover from a rival
known by instinct&mdash;Priscilla saw David Blake in a new
guise, and one not pleasant to her on this peaceful day
of spring.</p>

<p>She smiled at the newcomer, inclining her head a little
in the pretty, willowy fashion that Garth village loved.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve the better of me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do not remember
you at all. Stay, though,&#8221; she added, seeing the sunlight
on his face, with its inscrutable, wild eyes, &#8220;I seem now
to have known you long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five years ago, Priscilla,&#8221; he answered, with a laugh
which David swore was false to the note of throstles and
all wholesome things.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me to remember some one I knew at fourteen,&#8221;
said Priscilla quietly. &#8220;It seems long ago to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>David went to smooth the flanks of the roan cow, who
turned her head and licked his waistcoat tranquilly from
the topmost to the lowest button.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him now,&#8221; growled the smith. &#8220;Garth has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
been well rid of him these five years, to my thinking.
Pity&#8217;s he&#8217;s come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced again at the other man, and was overtaken
by an impulse to throw his adversary bodily out of the
mistal-yard; so he pulled himself together, as one who
was accustomed to follow kindly instincts only.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be jogging, Priscilla,&#8221; he said, making for
the door. &#8220;The cow is ailing naught so much, and &#8217;tis
time I got to smithy-work again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve forgotten me too, David?&#8221; said the
stranger airily, as Blake was pushing past him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; answered David, not seeing the proffered hand.
&#8220;I remember you well, Gaunt of Marshlands&mdash;and I&#8217;ll
bid you good day, as I was ever glad to do.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THAT&#8217;S a pleasant sort of welcome, eh?&#8221; said
Reuben Gaunt, as he watched David&#8217;s broad back
disappear round the corner of the stables.</p>

<p>Priscilla&#8217;s interest was awakened already, and the smith
had done an ill turn to his own cause by arousing her
sympathy as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find pleasanter welcomes here in Garth,&#8221; the
girl answered, with that candour of thought and expression
which in itself was dignity. &#8220;It was stupid of me
to forget you, Mr. Gaunt, but I was so little, when you
used to play big brother to me and show me all the wonders
of the Dene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it must not be Mr. Gaunt. The folk who like
me call me Reuben, as you did once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was vaguely disturbed. Softness of speech
and manner she understood, for she had ever been a favourite
with the landed gentlefolk of Strathgarth; and, because
she understood them, she detected the false note
in Gaunt&#8217;s would-be correctness. Yet she pushed the
distrust aside; for this man had been away from Garth
for five long years, had seen the mysteries hidden in the
beyond, and doubtless he could tell her of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are older now,&#8221; she answered, a little smile belying
her rebuke. &#8220;It must be Mr. Gaunt, or naught at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, it must be Miss Priscilla, too?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be fitting, I think. Five years are not
bridged in a moment, and father tells me I&#8217;m a woman
grown, though I feel a child when the spring comes in as
it is coming now.&#8221;</p>

<p>An older and more constant playmate than Gaunt of
Marshlands sang to her&mdash;sang blithe and high&mdash;through
the mistal-door; but she scarcely heard the throstle, for
Gaunt brought news from the beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been these years past?&#8221; she asked,
moving restlessly from foot to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everywhere, I fancy,&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen the world, as I always meant to do; and a queer
world I&#8217;ve found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a child wipes the school-day&#8217;s sums from its slate,
Priscilla lost the record of her working and her playtime
hours. The grey serenity of Garth, the sweetness of its
roadside gardens, the slow, rich gossip of its folk&mdash;these
things went by her. She forgot the low, musical humming
of the churn, the look of the butter as it lay, round and
golden as a kingcup, on the stone tables of the dairy. She
heard no longer the splash of milk into the foamy pail,
the lowing of the kine as they gave their evensong of
praise.</p>

<p>Not restless now, she leaned against the stall, her eyes
wandering now and then to Gaunt&#8217;s, then returning to
the mistal-yard and the croft beyond. She was listening
to this man who had spent five years beyond the limits of
Garth village, and his tales enthralled her. In an absent
way she wondered that those well-known fields, the familiar
yard, had never seemed so small as now.</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt was talking well. The picture of the
girl, her lissome outline framed by the oaken stall, her
hands clasped above her head, the lights and shadows
of the mistal playing constantly about her eager eyes&mdash;these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
might well have moved a duller wit than Gaunt&#8217;s
to make the most of itself. And, when he stopped, Priscilla
was silent, her head thrown further back and her
glance going out and out, over the grey field-walls
of Strathgarth, over its dingles and its hills&mdash;out to the
borderland, and across into the unknown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come back suddenly,&#8221; she said at last.
&#8220;None knew in Garth that you were coming home, or
we must have heard of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I chose to return unawares, and see what sort of welcome
Garth would give me without preparation.&mdash;And,
gad, I learned from David Blake quite soon enough,&#8221; he
finished, with an easy laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall you stay among us?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been watching her during that long silence.
Faults in plenty the man had, but in his way he could
understand the finer lines of beauty; and now, as he met
Priscilla&#8217;s eyes, he found her exquisite&mdash;something as faultless,
and yet as natural, as a harebell swaying to the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I shall stay,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell, in answer, not to the words, but to the
tone. And, because she had been wont to look all folk
bravely in the eyes, she grew impatient of her shame-facedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot idle all the morning through,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you good day, Mr. Gaunt, and get to my housework.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Blake, meanwhile, had turned aside before he
reached his smithy, and had crossed, by the stile at the
road-corner, into the field where Farmer Hirst was busy
hedge-cutting with his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, David! Followed me up, like, have ye?&#8221;
roared Hirst, as he chanced to turn his head while the
smith was still half a field away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Ay, I like the sound and the look of cutting a thorn-hedge,&#8221;
answered David, as he drew nearer. &#8220;Thought
I&#8217;d come and set ye straight if ye were showing faulty
hedge-craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two farm-men turned with their bill-hooks in their
hands. They nodded at David and grinned at his simple
pleasantry. Lithe, clean-built fellows they were, both of
them, such as they breed within the boundaries of Strathgarth,
and they were friends and, save in the matter of
wage-earning, they were roughly the equals of their
master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ye, then,&#8221; chuckled the farmer. &#8220;See what
we&#8217;ve done a&#8217;ready, David! See how trim and snug the
whole line lies of it! Nay, not that way, lad!&#8221; he broke
off, as one of the hands began to lay a stout hawthorn
stem, sawn half-way through, all out of line with its fellow
on the left.</p>

<p>He bent the branch as he would have it lie, then stepped
aside&mdash;for a heavy man, Hirst was oddly active in his
movements&mdash;and set to work to pluck a root of dog-briar
from its deep bed. Twist and turn the root in his
hands as he might, it would not budge.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis all these durned leather gloves,&#8221; he said, throwing
his gauntlets off. &#8220;They keep the prickles out, David&mdash;or
reckon to&mdash;but when a body wants his naked hands&mdash;well,
let him wear them naked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he tugged, but the old root would not give; so
David grasped Priscilla&#8217;s father by the middle, and
&#8220;<i>Yoick!</i>&#8221; he cried, and they pulled together. The root
left its hold, more suddenly than they had counted on,
and David, being the hinder of the two, bore the full
brunt of the farmer&#8217;s fall.</p>

<p>David got to his feet by and by, and coaxed the wind
back into his lungs. Farmer Hirst was laughing till the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
tears ran down his ruddy face; the men were laughing,
too; so David, soon as he found breath, fetched out that
slow, deep body-merriment of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got him out o&#8217;ground! Oh, ay, we daunted yond
old briar-root!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Whereat the four laughed so heartily that a pair of
curlews&mdash;just returned, like Reuben Gaunt, from sojourning
God knew where&mdash;got up from the further side
of the fence, and went crying toward the moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Briar-roots are the devil and all,&#8221; said Hirst, &#8220;when
ye come to clean a hedge-bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear bonnie roses all the same, when June comes in,&#8221;
ventured the blacksmith, not telling Hirst that wild roses
reminded him, too often for his peace of mind, of Priscilla.
&#8220;Pity to stump &#8217;em up, say I, and pity came of my lending
my hand to the job just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made pretence to rub himself, as if the farmer&#8217;s
bulk had raised painful sores on him. It is easy to laugh
when the spring&#8217;s a-coming in, and the four workers
startled a black-faced ewe that was near to her first lambing
season.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away wi&#8217; your jests, David,&#8221; answered Farmer
Hirst. &#8220;D&#8217;ye think I want to have my lambs dropped
hasty-like in the ditch down yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet by and by, when they had worked their fill at the
hedge-cutting, and it was dinner-time, David drew the
farmer aside. He had not known till now what had brought
him to the fields here, instead of to the smithy where he
had urgent work to do. For the blacksmith&#8217;s brain was
like an eight-day clock that stands in the kitchen corner;
it moved slowly&mdash;<i>tick-tack, tick-tack</i>, with sober repetition&mdash;but,
when the moment came to strike the hour, there
was never any doubt as to the time he had in mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Hirst,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ne&#8217;er mind your dinner yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
awhile. I&#8217;ve somewhat lies on my chest, as a body might
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I lay there not a long while since, a trifle sudden
and a trifle hard,&#8221; laughed Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, will ye be quiet? I&#8217;m like Fool Billy, as
Priscilla said just now, and ye think I&#8217;m jesting when I&#8217;m
trying to talk sober sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner-time is sober sense, David, judging by my
itch to get at cheese and bread and good brown ale. What
then, lad? What ails ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m slow of speech, unlike my smithy-bellows,&#8221; went
on the other doggedly. &#8220;I find the right word always
the day after to-morrow, instead of the day&#8217;s minute that
I want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a trick of the same kind myself, David. What
then? Speech is speech, but trimming a thorn-hedge, or
ploughing for your turnip-crop, is a sight better than
hunting words. Tuts, David! Ye&#8217;re yellow about the
gills, and some trouble&#8217;s sitting on ye, by that token.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, some trouble is,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Priscilla gave ye cake and ale?&#8221; put in the other anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She forgot to offer it, and I forgot to lack it.&#8221; David&#8217;s
eyes followed the neat line of the hedge, and he nodded
gravely at it. &#8220;Wish men were more like thorn-bushes,
John&mdash;wish you could lop their unruliness, and twist
their ill-grown branches into shape, and make a clean,
useful hedge at the end of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farmer Hirst was thinking of his dinner with gaining
tenderness. &#8220;What is in your mind, David, lad?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;&#8217;Tis like watching the kettle boil, this getting
at your meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben Gaunt is back again in Garth,&#8221; the smith
blurted out. &#8220;That&#8217;s my meaning, John, and I tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
we could well have let him stay t&#8217; other side of the world,
and ne&#8217;er have missed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s face clouded for a moment. &#8220;We could
have spared him&mdash;ay. But what of it? Because a fool
chooses to come home again, are we to go pulling fiddle-faces
on a blithesome day like this? Hark ye, David, I&#8217;ll
not bide a minute longer; there&#8217;s cheese and ale all waiting
in the hedge-bottom yonder, and you&#8217;re going to share it
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So David laid his trouble aside for the moment, and
the four of them sat on the sunny hedge-bank, and said
little until for the second or third time they took more
cheese to help the butter out, or more bread to help the
cheese out, or another pull of ale &#8220;to settle the lot trimly
into place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful March weather,&#8221; said the farmer, draining
a last draught. &#8220;Near to April, and not a lamb-storm
yet. &#8217;Twill be twelve year since I remember such a
spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found a primrose fair in bloom this morn,&#8221; said one
of the farm-men. &#8220;Wonderful weather, I&#8217;ll own, farmer&mdash;but
what&#8217;s to come with April? Mistrust these easiful,
quiet March-times myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, get ye along!&#8221; cried Hirst. &#8220;Believe the best o&#8217;
the weather, I, and always did. They laugh at me in
Shepston market&mdash;say I&#8217;m no true farmer, because I&#8217;ll
not speak o&#8217; the weather as if she were a jade for any man
to mock at.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence, while the men lay tranquilly against
the bank and watched the blue sky trail her draperies of
cool, white fleece across the west wind&#8217;s track.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben Gaunt is back, I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; said one of the
farm-hands presently. &#8220;Came last night, all unbeknownst-like,
same fashion as he left, five years since.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be brisk times for the lasses, then,&#8221; put in
his fellow drily.</p>

<p>Again the farmer&#8217;s face darkened for a moment. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
work-time, lads, not gossip-time, and many a yard of
hedge to fettle up before we get our suppers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be getting to my own work, too,&#8221; said David,
nodding his farewells and moving down the field.</p>

<p>At another time he would have put his own work off,
would have taken a hand till nightfall with the hedge-trimmers,
would have given them jest for jest and laugh
for laugh, while he trimmed, and cut, and bent the hawthorn
boughs into their place. But to-day he could not.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a brisk time for the lasses, then,&#8221; he muttered,
echoing the farm-hand&#8217;s idle speech. &#8220;Ay, there&#8217;s
always trouble o&#8217; that sort when Reuben Gaunt&#8217;s at
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the quiet fields he went, but they brought little
benediction to him. He remembered Gaunt and all his
ways, remembered how, when he left Garth, there had
been no sadness in the men&#8217;s faces, but grief and bitterness
in many women&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the dangment do they see in him, these lasses?&#8221;
growled David, as he climbed the wall and dropped into
the highroad. &#8220;Littlish in the build&mdash;face as good to look
at as a mangold-wurzel&#8217;s&mdash;must be those devil&#8217;s eyes of
his, that never lie still for a moment, but go hunting like
a dog that sniffs a fresh scent every yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>David had summed up his man with unerring judgment
in that last thought&mdash;so far, that is, as we can judge of
any man. Had Gaunt been downright evil, it would have
been easier for the men of Garth to have thrashed him
long ago into a likelier and more wholesome habit. But
even to-day, when he was in a mood that, for him, was
bitter, the blacksmith knew that his enemy was neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
good nor bad, but purposeless. He had watched him grow
from childhood; and year by year his name of Reuben
seemed more and more a prophecy of days to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unstable as water&mdash;ay, just that,&#8221; thought David,
as he reached the smithy.</p>

<p>Billy the Fool, after dusting the smithy fire with coke
and smudge, had settled himself to sleep again; but he
was awake on the instant when David&#8217;s footsteps sounded
on the roadway. He rose, and shook himself with a big,
heedless satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a-dreaming, David,&#8221; was his greeting.
&#8220;Dreamed I was wise, like ye are at most times&mdash;saving
when Miss Priscilla comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay?&#8221; said the other, patting Billy on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like it, David! Glad to waken is Billy the
Fool. There wasn&#8217;t no frolic in&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can believe you, lad. What news, Billy, since I went
up street?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the habit in Garth village to ask Billy for news,
however many times a day you met him, though none
could say how the idle custom had first come into use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, there&#8217;s news. I&#8217;ve been at my games again, David
the Smith.&#8221; A smile broadened slowly across the placid
face, while the blacksmith listened good-humouredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never met your like for games, Billy,&#8221; he said, fingering
his tools after the fashion of a man who means to begin
work by and by, but not just yet.</p>

<p>David, indeed, was thinking less of work, and less of
Billy, than of the encounter in the mistal. Reuben Gaunt
had come like a shadow between the springtime and himself,
had blurred the sun for him: keen to foresee, as slow
men often are, the blacksmith felt as if a blight had fallen
on Garth village, checking the warmth, holding the green
buds in their sheaths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Yet Billy soon claimed his ear. &#8220;I&#8217;d looked to your
fire,&#8221; went on the natural, &#8220;and stepped out into the
road, to see what time o&#8217; day it was. Perhaps a half-hour
since it was&mdash;and what d&#8217;ye think, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t guess, lad, couldn&#8217;t guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there was a littlish man, all dressed up as if
&#8217;twere Sunday; and he came down the road, and I knew
he&#8217;d been to Good Intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>David glanced sharply up. &#8220;How did you know
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Priscilla lives there. All the younger men&mdash;and
happen a few o&#8217; the old uns too&mdash;will always be wending
Good Intent way when the spring comes in. Habit o&#8217;
theirs, David&mdash;habit o&#8217; theirs! I go that way myself
sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The blacksmith, not for the first time, was puzzled
by Billy the Fool. The natural&#8217;s unerring instinct for all
that made for the primitive in bird or beast or human-folk,
when coupled with his child&#8217;s disdain of everyday good
sense, would have troubled keener wits than David&#8217;s.
He recognized Reuben Gaunt, moreover, from the other&#8217;s
description, and he fingered his tools no longer, but followed
Billy&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Came whistling down the road, did the littlish chap.
I wondered, like, at what, for ye or me could have outsized
him two or three times over.&#8221;</p>

<p>David laughed, though he was little in the mood for it.
At every turn of his path to-day&mdash;whether he were talking
to Priscilla, or dining in the hedge-bottom with Farmer
Hirst, or talking to Billy&mdash;Gaunt&#8217;s shadow crossed his
path. Yet he laughed, for he was simple, too, and big, and
there was something that tickled his fancy in this quiet
assumption that little men had little right to whistle on the
Queen&#8217;s highway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Came whistling down, did he?&#8221; asked the blacksmith,
strangely eager for the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and stopped when he saw me. &#8216;Flick-a-moroo!&#8217;
says he, and twitched my chin, and seemed to think he&#8217;d
played a jest on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again David chuckled; for there was none in the Dale
of Strathgarth that could mimic a man as faithfully as
Billy, and he had caught Gaunt&#8217;s mincing accent to the
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Flick-a-moroo</i>,&#8217; says I, easy as answering a blackbird
when he calls. I didn&#8217;t like having my chin tickled, David,
but I bided like, as one might say. And then he says&mdash;&#8217;tis
queer and strange how little a grown man can be, yet
can strut like a turkey-cock&mdash;&#8216;Ye seem to know what&#8217;s
the meaning of <i>flick-a-moroo</i>&#8217; says he, &#8216;though it&#8217;s more
than I do.&#8217; &#8216;Ay, I know the meaning of <i>flick-a-moroo</i>,&#8217; I
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, lad?&#8221; asked David, waiting till he had finished
a laugh that came before the end of the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see, David&#8221;&mdash;a happy, cunning look was in the
natural&#8217;s face&mdash;&#8220;ye see, we were near t&#8217; other side o&#8217;
the road yonder, and I minded there was a snug, far drop
over th&#8217; wall, and some young nettles growing soft as a
feather-bed. So I says again, &#8216;Oh, ay,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I know
the meaning o&#8217; <i>flick-a-moroo</i>,&#8217; says I; and I catches him,
heels and head&mdash;&#8217;twould have made ye crack wi&#8217; laughter,
David, to see it&mdash;and I holds him over the wall awhile,
and drops him soft as a babby into th&#8217; nettles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again David laughed. He could not help it. &#8220;And
then, Fool Billy?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I went and looked at him, and I says, &#8216;Oh, ay,
I know what&#8217;s the meaning o&#8217; <i>flick-a-moroo</i>,&#8217; says I&mdash;&#8216;and
so do ye, I&#8217;m thinking.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>David felt a joy in this daft enterprise as keen as Billy&#8217;s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Was it not the expression of feelings which he had himself
only checked with an effort up yonder in the mistal-yard?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas outrageous, and not like ye, Billy,&#8221; the smith
observed, his whole face twinkling. &#8220;Should&#8217;st be more
civil when strangers come to Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked apprehensive for a moment; of all things,
after work, he hated the reproof of those whom, in his
innocence, he fancied to be wiser than himself. A glance
at David&#8217;s face, however, reassured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Civil when strangers are civil, David,&#8221; he chuckled.
For Billy, vague as his outlook upon morals was, showed
himself persistently on the side of the Old Testament.
&#8220;I&#8217;d bested him, ye see! Owned he didn&#8217;t know what
<i>flick-a-moroo</i> meant. Billy the Fool did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a change of play, Billy,&#8221; said the smith.
&#8220;Just make the bonnie sparks go scummering up again,
and I&#8217;ll to my work o&#8217; making horseshoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>David stole many a look at the other&#8217;s face as they
went forward with their labour. He was realizing that
there were possibilities of tragedy about this lad with the
big frame and the dangerous strength. It was a jest to
drop a man gently into a bed of nettles&mdash;but what if
Billy&#8217;s passion were roused in earnest? What if some one
pierced through that slothful outer crust of his, and
touched some deeper instinct in him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Might be a sort of earthquake hidden in poor Billy,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;&#8217;Tis hard to guess what he&#8217;s thinking of,
right at the beating heart of the chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smith would have been astonished, had he been
able to sound these heart-beats of his comrade&#8217;s. It was
Priscilla he was thinking of&mdash;Priscilla of the Good Intent&mdash;Priscilla,
who brought the sunshine into Garth for
one poor fool whenever she crossed his path.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be fettling up the house-place now, I reckon,&#8221;
said Billy suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Priscilla. &#8217;Tis her time of day for doing
on&#8217;t. Te-he, David! I hoicked yon chap fair grandly
over th&#8217; wall&mdash;Sunday clothes, and <i>pritty-prat</i> speech,
and all. Nettles don&#8217;t sting i&#8217; March, they say&mdash;but I&#8217;ve
known &#8217;em do that same.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SPRING was abroad indeed these days. Garth village,
good to see even in grey winter-time, grew to the
likeness of a well-kept garden. The winding street&mdash;white
at one time, then glistening-grey when the sun shone
on it through April rain&mdash;moved lazily between the cottages
and the yeomen&#8217;s square, substantial houses. And
always, between the house-front and the highway, there
was a garden, big or little. Sometimes&mdash;when the cottage
was so small in itself that there seemed no room for
a garden-space&mdash;there would be a strip, no more than
two feet wide, fenced round to guard it from the wandering
ducks and geese and dogs of Garth. Sometimes a bigger
house would shrink, with disdainful pride, from too close
a rubbing of shoulders with the street; and its garden
would be wide and guarded by a grey stone wall, with a
white-painted gate in the middle of the wall.</p>

<p>But always, right and left of the good street of Garth,
there were gardens, and, whatever their size or shape
might be, the same flowers bloomed in all. Crocuses still
glowed yellow when the sun came out to waken them;
but these were of the older generation, and daffodils
were nodding already high above them with the effrontery
of youth. Auriculas were showing the white miller&#8217;s-dust
about their buds; the ladslove bushes pushed out green,
fragrant spikes into this unexpected weather; primroses
caught the laughter of the spring, and celandines looked
humbly at the sunlight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Priscilla of the Good Intent, as she came down the
street, was no way out of keeping&mdash;so the kindly gossips
said, standing each at her sunlit door&mdash;with the gardens
and the weather. For it was true that not men only, but
women, were reminded always of a flower when their eyes
fell on Priscilla; and each was apt to choose his own
favourite flower as Cilla&#8217;s namesake.</p>

<p>The village parliament, made up of men and women
both, is seldom wrong when it passes judgment on a
neighbour; and there was none in Garth who would deny
off-hand that Priscilla of the Good Intent was rightly
named, thanks to the title of the farm on which her father,
and his fathers before him, had laboured thankfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes slim Miss Good Intent,&#8221; said one cottager
to another, across the quickset hedge that parted
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay! Sunshine all along the street,&#8221; the other answered.
&#8220;Trust she&#8217;ll fall into a good man&#8217;s hands;
for into some hands she&#8217;ll fall soon, or else a lad will just
reach up and pluck her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla had smiled and nodded to them as she passed&mdash;nodded
and smiled, indeed, the length of Garth Street,
as if she were the lady of the village. She was no less,
indeed, for she had that simple pride which knows its
station and disdains no greeting on life&#8217;s highroad. Unspoiled
as a primrose, opening to the warmth of spring,
was Priscilla; and it seemed the pity of life that she should
ever have to meet contrary winds.</p>

<p>Billy the Fool, at the extreme end of Garth, was passing
the time of day with David the Smith, as his wont was;
for the two were rather like an elder and a younger brother,
and sought each other out by instinct. It was two weeks
and a day since Billy had dropped his victim into a bed
of growing nettles, and neither he nor David had spoken of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the matter since&mdash;the blacksmith, because he was too
fastidious, in a rough fashion, when a rival was in
case; the natural, because he forgot such trifles until
the season for remembrance came. Reuben Gaunt, for
his part, had kept silence, and had thanked heaven, in
his own random way, that the jest of his sitting down
among the nettles was not common gossip now in Garth.
For Reuben hated to be laughed at, as the half and between
men of this world always shrink from the laughter
of their neighbours.</p>

<p>&#8220;The birds are all a-mating and a-building, David the
Smith,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Cannot ye hear the throstles calling
to the hen-birds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; growled David, a sudden anger coming to him;
&#8220;but ye and me are no way mated, Billy the Fool. What
ails us, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Life ails us,&#8221; said Billy unexpectedly. &#8220;We&#8217;re over
slow and overpleasant, David. Chase &#8217;em and have &#8217;em,
David the Smith&mdash;that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve seen the bird-folk
go a-wooing. Te-he, there&#8217;s Miss Priscilla!&#8221; he broke
off, and seemed about to run and greet her, in his friendly,
dog-like way, when a second figure came into the street
from the bridle-track that led to Thorlburn.</p>

<p>The natural stopped, suddenly as if he had been indeed
a dog and his master had whistled him down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Garth Street is not what it used to be, David,&#8221; he
observed, dispassionately. &#8220;More muckiness about the
roads, though why I know not, seeing they&#8217;re smooth and
silver at this moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>David said nothing for awhile; but he saw Reuben
Gaunt lift his cap to Priscilla, with that indescribable
air of overdoing the matter which roused the blacksmith&#8217;s
temper. He saw, too, that they stayed and chatted&mdash;Priscilla
laughing&mdash;and afterwards went up the Thorlburn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
bridle-way, which led to a field-track winding at
long last to Good Intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Billy,&#8221; said the smith&mdash;his voice came suddenly,
and was half-brother to a sob&mdash;&#8220;come away in
and play at blowing the bellows, while I fire the ends of
those posts that Farmer Hirst is wanting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he want &#8217;em for, like?&#8221; asked the natural,
curious at all times.</p>

<p>&#8220;To make a pen for yon rambling turkeys. The hens
will go wandering after the cock-bird, and they&#8217;re laying
in the hedge-bottoms, and over t&#8217; other side the beck,
and Lord knows where. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t the hens I blame, Billy;
&#8217;tis the ruffling master-bird, with his tail spread like a silly
peacock&#8217;s. Pen him in we will, Billy&mdash;and, if he breaks
his neck in the wire-netting, so much the better for all
sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was rarely that David allowed himself so stormy an
outbreak. Had he taken his wooing in this fashion two
weeks and a day ago in the farmyard of Good Intent,
breaking down the barriers of diffidence&mdash;Priscilla&#8217;s
and his own&mdash;there might have been a different life-tale
for David the Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he!&#8221; chuckled Billy the Fool, shambling toward
the smithy. &#8220;&#8217;Twould be a rare game to pen in the turkey-cock.
<i>Gobble-gobble di-gobble</i>, he goes, whenever he comes
across the likes o&#8217; me, and his wattle goes red as the floor,
David, when a man&#8217;s been killing a cow. Ay, I&#8217;ll blow
the bellows for ye, if so ye&#8217;re going to prison up yond old,
prideful devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soothes a body&#8217;s temper,&#8221; muttered David, after he
had been at work for half an hour&mdash;thrusting the pine-posts
into the blaze, turning them about, taking them
away when the pointed ends were charred sufficiently,
while Billy played contentedly and hard with the bellows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
&#8220;God knows I&#8217;d like to see Priscilla happy, with me or
another man; but Reuben Gaunt sticks in my gizzard
like a fish-bone.&#8221; He laughed quietly, for he always
sought from humour an antidote against the storm-winds
of life. &#8220;Suits me, seemingly,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;to
be fair mad with a man; for work takes the tetchy humours
out of ye, and work pays ye afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Could David have left his forge more often, in order
to seek Priscilla&#8217;s company&mdash;and he was well-found
already in the bread and cheese of life, and knew that
there were savings of the years behind him&mdash;could David
have understood that a maid, if you love her and she
chances to love you, needs wooing with a desperate seriousness
and a desperate gaiety&mdash;he would have been less
interested to-day in the making of charred posts wherewith
to furnish forth John Hirst&#8217;s turkey-pen.</p>

<p>Priscilla, meanwhile, was wandering up the bridle-track
with Reuben Gaunt, and the little, plain-featured man
with the wild eyes was talking to her&mdash;talk being his
prime work in life&mdash;and telling her of the countries he
had seen, the busy streets, the things remote from Garth&#8217;s
quiet highroad, and Garth&#8217;s quiet hill-slopes where the
work of farming life was done.</p>

<p>Like cloud-land drifting before a merry wind, the old
life went receding from Priscilla of the Good Intent. The
street of Garth grew dull; the singing of a farm-hand, as
he strode up the hilly field in front of them, was so much
noise in a rustic bauble-shop. Reuben Gaunt&#8217;s plain face,
his little body, receded too, and only his wild eyes were
left&mdash;the eyes that looked into hers and reflected, so she
thought, the world beyond Garth village.</p>

<p>Billy the Fool, had he been in this quiet lane, would
have been finding the first wild-strawberry bloom, or
another blackbird&#8217;s nest; but Priscilla, who had loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
such things aforetime, was looking far beyond them
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had seen so many countries, and there were more
to see. Yet you return to Garth,&#8221; said Priscilla suddenly.</p>

<p>They had halted at the gate that opened on the field-track
to Good Intent, and the girl was leaning with her
arms upon the topmost bar. The long and quiet glance
she gave her companion was childish in its wonderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;to stay, I doubt. &#8217;Tis free and pleasant to go
roaming; but a man grows tired of earning his bread as
best he can. I&#8217;ve been a jockey, a trainer, a gold-miner&mdash;a
publican, Lord help me, for one whole year&mdash;and all
seemed to leave me as poor as it found me, Priscilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a little sign of the new days, but a clear one, that
the girl&#8217;s pride was content with his half-tender, half-easy
use of her name. She did not call him Mr. Gaunt, but
avoided any name when speaking to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you had the life&mdash;the life.&#8221; Her voice was almost
passionate. &#8220;You did not see the same hills every
day, and churn the butter whenever Thursday came, and
milk the cattle o&#8217; nights and mornings, from spring&#8217;s
beginning to winter&#8217;s end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cilla&mdash;yet, somehow, when the old folk died and
left me Marshlands, and word came to me that the snug
property was mine, I longed for the home-fields&mdash;longed
to settle down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben was sincere in this, so far as his way of life
allowed him to be sincere in anything. He was glad to
be home again, glad to revisit nooks and corners which
he had known in boyhood. Even the wanderers need their
rest sometimes, and this man with the queer, wild eyes
was fonder of Garth village than he had ever known.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must take a wife, Priscilla, now that I have something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to keep her on,&#8221; he went on, leaning against the
gate-post and stroking his upper lip. &#8220;Marshlands will
never thrive unless it has a mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla looked straight in front of her, with a heedlessness
that angered Gaunt. Keen-witted as he was, he
should have known that Yeoman Hirst&#8217;s daughter was
not one to be wooed at the end of two weeks and a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;twill need a mistress,&#8221; she said, indifferently.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were all of the new lands that Gaunt had
opened to her fancy, and she would have answered, had
she been asked the reason of her interest in Reuben, that
he was the bringer of stirring news, and heartsome news,
into the round of her life at Garth.</p>

<p>Gaunt was silent for awhile; wooing had sped so easily
with him in times past that contempt or opposition ruffled
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you choose my wife for me, Cilla?&#8221; he said
at last, with would-be playfulness. &#8220;Fair or dark is she,
and can she manage a dairy and a roomy house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not thought of it,&#8221; said Priscilla, turning her
candid eyes on him again. &#8220;&#8217;Tis for you to settle such
grave questions, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laughter hurt him afresh; and, while he was seeking
for a way to meet rebuffs he little liked, John Hirst came up
the road. Hirst was not one to scowl at any time; but
his thick brows came together when he reached the top
of the rise and saw these two together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crossing homeward by the fields, Priscilla?&#8221; he cried,
in a voice that startled them like thunder out of a tranquil
sky. &#8220;Well, so am I, and we&#8217;ll just gang together, lassie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, Mr. Hirst,&#8221; said Gaunt, soon as he had
recovered from his surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; answered the other gruffly,
opening the gate. &#8220;Come, Priscilla&mdash;we&#8217;ll go arm in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
arm, as your mother came from kirk with me more
years ago than I remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla felt a big hand grasp her arm, and found herself,
with no time for a good-by to Reuben, moving quickly
up the field-path at her father&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the farmer, presently.</p>

<p>Priscilla did not answer, but released her arm, and set
a little distance between them as they crossed the fields.
She was angered that her father had shown discourtesy&mdash;a
thing uncommon with him&mdash;to the man who had
laid strange, vivid colours on the palette of her fancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re out of temper with your dad,&#8221; said Hirst,
a big laugh forcing its way, willy-nilly, through all his
disquiet. &#8220;So was your mother, over and over again,
before I brought her safely to kirk. Hearken to me, little
lass. Oldish men are foolish men, they say, and forget
their youth; but Billy the Fool talks wonderful sense, just
time and time, so I may do it with safety, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>He halted to stroke the flanks of the roan cow which
David had lately saved, then stole a look at his daughter&#8217;s
face, and found rebellion there.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis as old as the hills, lass, this tale of what to do,
and what not to do,&#8221; he went on, his voice quite gentle on
the sudden. &#8220;Two folk leaning over a gate&mdash;a lad and a
lass&mdash;and no harm done, maybe. Did it myself, when
your mother was slim as you and I was courting her. But
ye want the right lad and the right lass, Priscilla, for that
sort of gate-over-leaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was no want wit, and the years had taught her
that Yeoman Hirst could never so subdue his voice unless
he were deeply moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, &#8217;tis so perplexing,&#8221; she said, taking his arm
again in obedience to a friendship that was like no other
in Garth village, save that between the blacksmith and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
crony. &#8220;I do not like to see you disdain Reuben
Gaunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why, if I might ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because there&#8217;s something bigger than Garth and its
grey street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something lesser, too, I reckon. Go on, lassie. I
felt the same myself once, and tried t&#8217; other thing, and
came back in great content to Garth. I once&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world beyond, father!&#8221; she broke in, with one
of those passionate gusts that were apt to surprise folk
who thought her even-tempered and reserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay&mdash;a small world, Priscilla,&#8221; chuckled John Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet <i>you</i> longed for it once&mdash;father, you know how
we have sat on Sabbath evenings in the brink-fields, and
watched the sun go down, and played at seeing lakes and
rivers and steep mountains in the clouds. &#8217;Tis the same
with me now. Reuben Gaunt has talked of strange cities,
strange countries, lying out beyond the cloud-line yonder&mdash;and,
oh, I want to get to them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben Gaunt <i>would</i> talk that sort of trash!&#8221; said
Hirst, the strength and the stubbornness of the man showing
plainly. &#8220;A here to-day and gone to-morrow man, is
Reuben, lass, whether ye like to hear me say it or no.
Cities and countries are there, over beyond where Sharprise
cuts the sky? Well, then, they&#8217;re men and women
in them, and men and women have been much the same
since Adam&#8217;s time, I take it, save for tricks of speech
and wearing-gear. You&#8217;d find naught different to Garth,
Priscilla&mdash;but ye&#8217;d miss the homely hills, and the clover-fields,
and the look of Eller Brook when spring is painting
both banks yellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla, because in her heart of hearts she was disposed
to think her father right, was bent all the more, in her
present mood, on being out of sympathy with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;I should like to see them&mdash;should like to judge for
myself, father, as you and Reuben Gaunt have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Hirst had had his say, and now was minded to
smooth the rough edges, as good-tempered men are apt
to be when they have hurt a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall do, then,&#8221; he said, drawing her to him.
&#8220;Only choose a likelier comrade for the journey, lass,
when the time comes for leaving Good Intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the hedge which Hirst and his men
had been laying on the morning when Reuben Gaunt had
come afresh into Priscilla&#8217;s life. Trim and low it stretched,
the strokes of the bill-hook showing yellow between the
green, primal budding of the thorns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work, yond, though I say it myself,&#8221; muttered
Farmer Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, good work, father,&#8221; the girl answered absently.</p>

<p>She was not thinking of the thorn-hedge. Her father&#8217;s
&#8220;Choose a likelier comrade for the journey,&#8221; meant in
all kindliness and desire to warn her, had cleared her
outlook suddenly. Reuben Gaunt had looked love enough
in these two weeks to have lasted another man a year, but
she had disdained to acknowledge the meaning of his
glances. Priscilla&mdash;even to herself&mdash;seldom lost that
habit of drawing maiden skirts away from men when they
showed a disposition to intrude; but this morning she was
forced to see the matter in its true perspective. Words
dropped by Reuben, as if haphazard, recurred to her.
He was no longer the scarcely-seen interpreter of worlds
beyond her reach; he grew on the sudden to be the man
who had seen these lands beyond, and she wondered if that
wild look in his eyes were the mirror of something gallant
and good to look upon.</p>

<p>The girl was so silent and so grave that her father
twitted her good-naturedly. &#8220;Day-dreams, eh, lassie?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
They come in spring, I&#8217;ve noticed&mdash;ay, even to grizzled
elders like myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Day-dreams, or day-realities&mdash;I scarce know which,
father,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt, meanwhile, was smarting under a sense
of foolishness. Priscilla had laughed at him. The farmer
had sent him about his business as if he were a hind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get queer welcomes in this Garth,&#8221; he said, watching
father and daughter move up the fields. &#8220;&#8217;Twould
seem it&#8217;s naught at all to own Garth&#8217;s biggest house and
richest lands. Garth is a bit like Billy the Fool&mdash;likes
or dislikes at sight, and always did, however good a man&#8217;s
coat is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben was admitting unconsciously that his experience
of the bigger world had led him to expect a welcome
according to his station. He turned fretfully to return
across the fields&mdash;in all his movements and his way of
taking life he suggested something of a child&#8217;s perverseness,
as if his body had aged and left his soul behind in the race
of life.</p>

<p>He halted when he came to the first stile. His pride
was smarting; his love for Priscilla&mdash;which touched
already the random good in him&mdash;was rendered barren
for the moment by that one girl&#8217;s laugh of hers. Small
wonder that this man&mdash;who, after all, was as God made
him, and therefore to be pitied somewhat&mdash;had never
caught the fancy of the forthright villagers of Garth. He
was too big in his own eyes, too eager to see insult where
only friendly raillery was meant; too heedless of the truth
that the right word at the one right moment is more than
lands and raiment. Reuben could not stand against a real
insult, such as Farmer Hirst had given him just now; and
he sat on the stile and nursed his wrath, and, like his namesake,
he was unstable as the wind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>He watched the patient fields, where the sunlight glistened
on the clean, new blades of grass. Far up the pastures,
a glint of limestone caught the sun and showed a
track which, years ago, before he left Garth village, had
been a wooing-trail for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see Ghyll Farm again,&#8221; he said, getting
down from the stile.</p>

<p>It was one of the big moments of Gaunt&#8217;s life, had he
but known it. Yet he seemed to guess as little of it as the
wind which, like himself, was turned by any hill that met
it in its passage. He crossed the highroad, and climbed
the further stile, and went up the track that led him to
Ghyll Farm; and he whistled as he went, and moved with
an eager step which folk, less versed in the ways of Reuben
than the villagers of Garth, would have thought full of
purpose.</p>

<p>The farm stood high up on the rise where the pasture-fields
ran into the moor and lost themselves, and Reuben,
seeing the rough, black outline of it a half-mile ahead,
began to think of other days.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his thoughts, a big, strapping lass
came up from the shallow dingle that cut the moor in two.
She carried a basket of eggs on her arm, and she moved
with a lithe, free swing that was almost insolent in its
strength.</p>

<p>Gaunt forgot Priscilla, forgot her father&#8217;s insult. The
worse man in him stepped forth, triumphant and uncaring
as the girl who came to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, &#8217;tis you, Peggy?&#8221; said Gaunt, touching his
cap, but not lifting it with the flourish which exasperated
David the Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems so, Reuben,&#8221; she answered, setting down her
basket and standing with a hand on either shapely hip.</p>

<p>It was not easy to read the look in Peggy&#8217;s face. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
was derision, and rosy pleasure at the meeting, and defiance;
and Reuben was daunted a little, for he liked women
to go easily upon the rein.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home again, you see,&#8221; he said, awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems so. I heard you were back two weeks ago, and
fancied you were overproud these days to visit Peggy
Mathewson. Got a fine house of your own, and what not,
now your folk are dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used not to be overproud to visit you,&#8221; said Reuben,
his eyes catching fire at hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no. But that was years ago, and you were
always light to come and go, Reuben. D&#8217;ye remember
that you left without a good-by said?&#8221; she went on, the
grievance of five years coming out with sudden bitterness.
&#8220;Mother talked to ye, Reuben Gaunt&mdash;would have
thrashed you, I believe, but for your luck&mdash;mother is
strong as a man to this day, and that&#8217;s more than you will
ever be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben&#8217;s face was like a dog&#8217;s when he has done
amiss, and knows it, and tries to make you understand
that he is innocent. Of all the welcomes he had found in
Garth, this was the sharpest and most tantalizing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had my folk to think of, Peggy. &#8217;Twould have
broken father&#8217;s heart&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ay!&#8221; The girl was fine in the strength with
which she treated Reuben Gaunt. &#8220;You always had
somebody&#8217;s heart to think of, Reuben, when you wanted
to run wide and free from trouble. What of me, lad, left
here to think of things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking bonnier for the trouble, Peggy, left here
or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old trick o&#8217; yours, Reuben. Your arm was ever lithe
to slip about a lass&#8217;s waist, and your tongue to grasp a
lie.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>They looked at each other, and Priscilla of the Good
Intent was far away from Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could slip an arm about your waist this minute,
Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless&mdash;if I&#8217;d let you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood away from him, alert, secure, yet with a careless
touch of invitation in her glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your errand, Peggy?&#8221; he asked after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking a sitting of eggs to Hill End Farm. Folk
fight rather shy of mother and me, Reuben, but they seem
to know where to come when they want a clutch of Black
Minorca eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell into step beside her, and Peggy only shrugged
her shoulders. It was natural, and like old times, that
Gaunt should ask no leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carrying my eggs all in one basket,&#8221; she said, by and
by, after he had helped her over a clumsy stile. &#8220;Always
did, Reuben, if ye call to mind. &#8217;Tis a failing of the Mathewsons,
I&#8217;ve heard tell. They don&#8217;t look to see if the basket
is strong and well-found&mdash;they just take a daft fancy
to the look on&#8217;t, and pop the whole clutch in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here in Garth to be sneered at,&#8221; said Gaunt, with
sudden passion. &#8220;I knew it after the first day or two,
Peggy, but I&#8217;d looked for something different from
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always like yourself, Reuben.&#8221; The girl
looked at him with a quiet, impersonal surprise that was
almost pity. &#8220;You&#8217;d pour honey into one ear and trust
it to run out safely at the other. I&#8217;m the only lass in the
world to ye, eh? Those will-o&#8217;-wispish eyes of yours are
saying it. Yet honey stays sometimes; and a lass goes
on eating it, and finds the taste on&#8217;t sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt took the basket from her arm and set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
it down; and then he grasped her hands and stood facing
her. There was a suddenness and fire about him that
the girl liked to see&mdash;as she would have liked to find
the withes of her egg-basket not quite so slender as they
seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy, I&#8217;d thought to find a welcome here at Garth.
There&#8217;s a damned conspiracy against me, and yet I came
home again with soft and quiet thoughts enough, God
knows. You&#8217;ve failed me, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not seek me out, Reuben, till you were tired
of better folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More fool I, then, Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes you a fortnight to tire, I remember, and two
weeks chasing other game, and then you&#8217;re back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed suddenly. To know a man to the core
of him and find him wanting, and yet to be weak in his
hands when he returns&mdash;it is a plight which brings women
to the borderland where tears meet laughter. And tears
are apt to conquer in such a case, though laughter is the
safe, abiding road.</p>

<p>Across the ages came the call to the girl&#8217;s heart&mdash;&#8220;As
a hen gathers her chickens under her wing.&#8221; She heard
the voice. She was stronger than Reuben Gaunt, and
knew it, and her pity lay about him like a mother-wing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come close and hither, Reuben. There&#8217;s naught else
will do for ye, &#8217;twould seem,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis five years since I kissed ye, Peggy,&#8221; he said by
and by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; she answered, with a weariness that shamed her
big, straight body. &#8220;Ay, Reuben. We&#8217;re as we are made,
I reckon, and ye and me are equal fools, each in our own
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She picked up her basket, and they went along the quiet
fields together. The grass was growing under their feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and a lark was singing to the sun. There was no hint,
from lark or greening pastures, that this narrow sheep-track
which they followed was leading two folk into idleness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THOUGH spring blew warm and soft from the west
and Garth village saw its trim, quiet gardens blossom
out to welcome the young summer, there was unrest
about, as if an east wind blew.</p>

<p>Neighbours passed the time of day together, and farmers
from the hills came down and stayed to ask if this God&#8217;s
weather-time would last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely not,&#8221; was the answer always.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, likely not,&#8221; the farmers would agree, though their
wholesome, wind-blown faces suggested a more friendly
outlook even on the weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re looking glum-like, misters,&#8221; said Billy, stepping
up one morning to a group of them who stood chatting
in Garth. It was a week after Reuben Gaunt had walked
across the fields with Peggy Mathewson.</p>

<p>They were not aware of any special gloom, but began
to think it must be true if Billy said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll tell ye why,&#8221; went on the Fool imperturbably.
&#8220;Te-he! I&#8217;ll tell ye why, ye wise farm-folk. Simple and
fain to play am I; but I think a lot, just whiles and whiles,
and Billy can answer riddles when more sensible-like
folk seem bothered.&#8221;</p>

<p>These farmer-folk, who could guide a plough, turned all
to Billy the Fool, who could not guide his own reason.
They waited for him to tell the cause of their ailment&mdash;an
ailment of his own discovering, not of theirs&mdash;as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
he had been the village doctor or the village parson, or
something more practical than either; and Billy, finding
himself the hero of this springtime gathering in Garth
village, laughed vacantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell ye the answer to yond riddle in a brace of shakes,
farmers all. Easy as tumbling off a wall; but ye wise folk
look downwards when ye see a stone fence, and wonder
how ye&#8217;ll light. Shameful poor thing to wonder how
you&#8217;re going to fall off a wall. Never did think o&#8217; the
matter myself. Just climbs up, and drops soft-like down,
does Billy, and finds himself on t&#8217; other side somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ye&#8217;re plump enough to fall soft, Billy,&#8221; laughed a
red-cheeked farmer.</p>

<p>It was curious to see his brethren check the unruly
speaker with nods and murmurs; they were men, for the
most part, who had seen the frosts of April come to nip
the April buds, and therefore they were superstitious.
It boded ill to laugh at Billy the Fool when he wore the
look he did just now, for to them all naturals were &#8220;wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us, Billy,&#8221; said a grey old man coaxingly, as if
he held a baby in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I will, seeing ye put it that way.&#8221; The
natural&#8217;s placid smile roved from one to another of the
group. &#8220;Could tell ye in a twinkling, farmer-folk, if I
were minded to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts, thou&#8217;rt minded to,&#8221; said the grey old man,
coaxing still. &#8220;Ye can tell us how the weather sits, and
where the first nest goes a-building&mdash;surely ye can tell us
what&#8217;s the matter with Garth village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I could tell ye,&#8221; said Billy the Fool, his slow smile
spreading like quiet sunshine on them all. &#8220;&#8217;Tis Reuben
Gaunt ails Garth. Don&#8217;t need the likes o&#8217; he, misters;
he&#8217;s, as ye might say, a cuckoo in the wrong nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men looked at one another. Billy the interpreter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
had put into words for them a vague unrest that had been
with them during these past weeks. It was not that they
bore Gaunt of Marshlands ill will; they were too forthright
and too clean of habit to harbour malice. It was
rather that they all felt as if the grey village was itself
no longer; they had remembered Gaunt&#8217;s record before
he left them, and the peace that followed his long wanderings
abroad. And now, at a word from Billy, they understood
these matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t ye thought of it afore?&#8221; asked Billy, his lazy
eyes as full of laughter as a moorland pool when April
breezes sport across it. &#8220;Knew it myself the first
day I clapped een on Reuben Gaunt Te-he! Ye&#8217;re
fearful wise and terrible hard in the head-piece, misters,
but &#8217;tis soft Billy has to guide ye time and time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll give you credit for it too,&#8221; muttered the grey old
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never had money myself&mdash;not to speak of,&#8221; he said,
with a tranquil chuckle. &#8220;Spoils folk&#8217;s lives and bothers
&#8217;em, does money, so I&#8217;ve heard tell. Cannot lie under a
hedgerow on June nights and hear the birds a-twittering
them to sleep. Must be prisoned in a great big bed, must
folks wi&#8217; money, and have a great big roof sitting down on
them. Not for Billy the Fool, thank ye, that sort o&#8217; smothered
life! But there&#8217;s summat else, misters. Ye who&#8217;ve
got money, like, might do a service to Garth village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and how, if a body might ask?&#8221; said a kindly
farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, ye might take your shovels and a big sack,
each of ye, and ye might spade your money into &#8217;t
sack.&#8221;</p>

<p>A friendly smile passed from one to another of the
farmers. Billy the Dreamer had stepped in front of Billy
the Wise Fool, and they waited for a jest. There was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
fine, free suggestion of untold wealth about the lad&#8217;s talk
of a shovel and a sack that appealed to their humour. For
they had tended, all of them, the niggard fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then ye&#8217;d bring your sacks o&#8217; gold,&#8221; went on the
natural&mdash;his face was so solemn and so sly that none
could guess whether or not he knew that he was jesting&mdash;&#8220;and
ye&#8217;d pour your gold out right along the roadway
here, and Reuben Gaunt would never see that the daffy-down-dillies
were fuller of sunshine than the gold that
strewed Garth Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the grey old man. His
tone suggested the quietness of a man who sees a moorland
trout spreading dark fins in a pool, and moves warily to
tickle him out on to the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see,&#8221; went on Billy, with his inscrutable, large
air, &#8220;ye see, ye might put it to him this way. &#8216;Reuben
Gaunt,&#8217; ye&#8217;d say&mdash;or &#8216;Mister Reuben Gaunt,&#8217; seeing he
owns land&mdash;&#8216;silly boy Gaunt,&#8217; ye&#8217;d say, &#8216;just look ye
at all this shovelled gold that lines Garth Street.&#8217; And he&#8217;d
answer, &#8216;What o&#8217; that?&#8217; And ye&#8217;d answer back, &#8216;Silly
boy Gaunt,&#8217; ye&#8217;d say, &#8216;there&#8217;s a line of gold from here
to Elm Tree Inn. &#8217;Tis yours for asking,&#8217; ye&#8217;d say, &#8216;granted
ye do one thing. Oh, ay, &#8217;tis yours for sure, granted ye do
one thing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that one thing, Billy?&#8221; rapped out the
grey-haired farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that he&#8217;d quit Garth and take the gold along
with him. Never would miss gold and Reuben Gaunt
myself. What say ye, misters? Billy the Fool&#8217;s a child,
but somehow, as a chap might say, his head is screwed
on right foremost way. Give him your gold, say I, and
shift him out o&#8217; Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great laugh went up. These farmers, not greedy of
money by nature, but fond of it, as most north-born people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
are, saw the slow humour of that trail of gold which ended
at the Elm Tree Inn.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what when Reuben Gaunt had quitted, Billy?&#8221;
asked one.</p>

<p>Billy the Fool took out a black and antique pipe before
replying. There were half-a-dozen pouches waiting for
him on the instant, and he filled from the first offered&mdash;Priscilla&#8217;s
father&#8217;s, as it chanced&mdash;and borrowed a match.
Billy was always borrowing from his neighbours, and
thrived on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, look ye here, neighbour-folk,&#8221; he said, puffing
long trails of smoke into the sunlit quiet of Garth. &#8220;I
reckon there&#8217;d be ease of heart, and spring a-coming in,
when Reuben Gaunt had left us. Don&#8217;t know myself,
misters, but that&#8217;s what Billy the Fool has to say to ye wise
folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>They left him by and by, one or two of them patting
him affectionately on the shoulder, and went down the
street in twos and threes. It chanced to be market-day
in Shepston, as any dweller on the fells could have told,
seeing so many farmers in Garth Street at this hour of a
busy springtime morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slow and wise is Billy,&#8221; said one to the other as they
walked between the limestone wall on one hand, the budding
hedgerow on the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, knows a lot. Only lacks the trick o&#8217; letting out
all he knows, or we&#8217;d be wiser, Daniel, us folk in Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy meanwhile leaned placidly against the grindstone
which stood at the road-edge just this side of Widow
Lister&#8217;s cottage. The grindstone had been out of work
these many years, and the lichens gave it a mellow dignity
such as sits on old men after their labour is done, and well
done, and the resting-time has come. Perhaps, if you
had asked the lovers of Garth village to name their friendliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
landmark, they would have said at once, &#8220;Why, th&#8217;
old grindstone. Have leaned against it many a time, and
talked right good sense the while on summer&#8217;s evenings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was not talking now. One could not have said
whether he were thinking even, so imperturbably he
watched the smoke from his pipe curl up into the blue and
tranquil air. Yet, just as he had been the interpreter of
Garth&#8217;s unrest not long ago, he was the interpreter of
spring just now. Like some primeval dweller in the green
forests of a younger world, Billy the Fool looked out at
nature, and watched the seasons pass him, and knew that
weather and fresh air were relatives of his. They pitied
him in Garth, as having no kin; but Billy, had he found
words at any time in which to speak of it, could have told
them, with that sudden, easy laugh of his, that he had a
mother and sister-folk and brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might as well be wending down-street way,&#8221; he said at
last, shaking himself as he stood upright and knocking
out the ashes from his pipe. &#8220;Terrible lad to smoke is
Billy, and I feel the need of another pipeful, as a chap
might say. Will go and sit on the seat, under the old elm
tree, and happen a body&#8217;s body might come along and
offer me a fill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big tree in the roadway, fronting the inn to which
it gave its name, was browning fast, in token of green leaves
to come. The wide circle of the street here, where three
roads met, was shimmering in the sunshine as if new-washed
and wholesome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terrible fond of a seat is this plump lad,&#8221; murmured
Billy, sinking carefully into the oaken bench that circled
the great elm.</p>

<p>He sat there, empty pipe in mouth, and he watched
young April glow upon the inn-front and the further hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
behind. Great faith had Billy, and therefore great tranquillity;
and, though he hungered for another pipe, he
sat beneath the elm tree, as if tobacco fell, as dew falls,
from the skies of eventide.</p>

<p>As he waited, noting lazily for the twentieth time that
the wagtails had returned to Garth and were dusting
themselves in the roadway, Reuben Gaunt came down the
street. The natural saw him&mdash;scented him rather, so
it seemed&mdash;a hundred yards away; and he shifted the
empty pipe from one corner of his mouth to the other,
and gripped it with his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, Billy, give you good day!&#8221; said Gaunt, as
he came nearer. It was Reuben&#8217;s way at all times to
conciliate a fool, if he were strong and liable to play Fool&#8217;s-Day
jests with a man by dropping him into a nettle-bed.
&#8220;Give you good day, Billy. An empty pipe, eh? Well,
I&#8217;ve a full pouch at your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy yearned for another fill and another borrowed
match wherewith to light it; and they thought him weak
of will in Garth, but now he looked over and beyond the
tempter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye, no. I&#8217;ve smoked enough for a daft boy&#8217;s
head-piece to withstand that same,&#8221; he said, with the
courtesy which seldom failed him. &#8220;I be looking at the
springtime gathering over Garth, Mr. Gaunt, and I do
seem, as a witless chap might say, to have scant thought
for baccy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a right good brew of ale?&#8221; suggested Gaunt,
nodding at the grey and newly pointed front of the Elm
Tree Inn. Like a child, Reuben was always most eager
to have his way when he was thwarted. &#8220;A right good
brew of ale, Billy? You like it, so they say, and have a
head to stand it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>A second and an equal temptation came to Billy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Fool. He was silent for awhile, and turned the matter
round about in that queer mind of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye, no, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; he said at last, with desperate
sobriety. &#8220;I&#8217;m busy as can be with thinking o&#8217;
Miss Good Intent. She wouldn&#8217;t like to see either of
us drinking ale at this hour of a spring morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you good day again, Billy,&#8221; said Gaunt, his little
sense of humour leaving him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, glad to give ye good day,&#8221; answered Billy, and
watched Gaunt follow the line of the grey street.</p>

<p>Billy sat on beneath the elm tree and hoped for better
things than Reuben Gaunt could ever bring him. Yet
he looked wistfully from time to time, first at the inn-front,
then at his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re heartsome matters, now, are a half-pint of
beer and a pipe o&#8217; baccy. Ye&#8217;d own to yourself, Billy&mdash;now,
wouldn&#8217;t ye?&mdash;that they were heartsome matters,&#8221;
he murmured.</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt, meanwhile, had turned up the lane that
led to Good Intent. He knew that John Hirst would be
at Shepston market, and was sure therefore of his welcome
at the farm. He did not get as far as the house, however,
for Priscilla was standing in the home-croft as he came
through the stile. From sheer frolic she had donned a
sun-bonnet, pretending that this April sunshine was overwarm
to bear uncovered. The bonnet was pink, and her
simple gown was lavender-blue, and she looked, to Gaunt&#8217;s
eyes, the trimmest and the bonniest maid that he had seen
in all his travels.</p>

<p>She was feeding a noisy multitude of hens and turkeys,
and it was pleasant to see how carefully the bigger birds
refrained from stealing from the fowls&mdash;nay, left the
tit-bits to them often, and showed altogether the behaviour
of a big, good-tempered dog towards a small and fussy one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>It was the turkey-cock that first warned Priscilla of
Gaunt&#8217;s approach. The &#8220;prideful devil,&#8221; as Billy the
Fool had called him, was proving his right to the title in
good earnest. His tail was spread, his wattle grew and
grew until the head of him was crimson as a wild-rose
berry when autumn&#8217;s sunshine lights the hedgerows.
He made towards Gaunt, moreover, with little steps that
in their fretfulness and self-importance suggested comedy.</p>

<p>Priscilla turned to learn the reason of this outbreak,
and her eyes met Reuben&#8217;s. A delicate flush and a look
of pleasure in the girl&#8217;s candid face was Gaunt&#8217;s welcome&mdash;a
greeting which John Hirst would have understood
had he been there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day,&#8221; she said sedately, and turned to feed
her birds again.</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see the turkey-cock&#8217;s welcome, Cilla? All
the male folk of Garth seem out of humour with me somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was another sign of the new days which Reuben had
ushered into Garth&mdash;one of those signs which are no
bigger than a cloud the size of a man&#8217;s hand&mdash;that Priscilla
of the Good Intent did not resent the shortened name
which few but her father had been privileged to use till
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are out of heart with life,&#8221; she said, scattering
the last of the food abroad and turning to meet his glance
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, life&#8217;s out of heart with me, Cilla. They seem
to think I&#8217;m lying, these Garth folk, when I tell them I&#8217;d
be glad to be here again among the old home-fields, if only
they would let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was sincere. It was a dangerous gift of his,
this habit of speaking what was truth for the moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
though it had no quality of strength and purpose behind
it.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous gift of his, too, that women were
compelled, when near him, to feel an odd, protective instinct.
Peggy Mathewson had felt the motherhood of life
rise up and cloud her judgment as she walked with Reuben
a week ago through the sunlit fields; and now Priscilla
of the Good Intent felt pity&#8217;s strength awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a bad habit,&#8221; she said, moving a little closer to
him, &#8220;this being out of heart with life, Reuben&#8221;&mdash;forgetting
that she had vowed to call him Mr. Gaunt perpetually.
&#8220;There&#8217;s enough and to spare of gladness, and
we must just search for it when times fare ill. Shame on
you, to go whimpering like a child when spring is flooding
all the countryside!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not thinking for the moment of those fairy seas
and lands which Gaunt had painted for her. In this quiet
field, with the turkeys and the fowls about her, she was
answering the prime instinct of all human life&mdash;to better
a sad man&#8217;s outlook on the world by spoken word, and, if
need were, by that touch of hand on hand which she had
disdained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla,&#8221; said Gaunt, his face a man&#8217;s at last, because
for his little moment he had gripped hold of love. &#8220;Cilla,
you&#8217;re the sunlight and the joy of life to me. Have you
never thought of wedlock?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl withdrew and put a hand to her skirt of lavender-blue
as if by instinct, and looked at the distant
hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seldom think of it,&#8221; she answered crisply. &#8220;The
spring and the needs of the feathered flock are enough
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they, Cilla? What of the beyond lands&mdash;or
was I dreaming when you said you&#8217;d like to see them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Priscilla only smiled with the dainty aloofness which
angered Reuben and enticed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis April,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m entitled to my whimsies,
like the weather. Besides, I met Billy the Fool in
the lane yestreen, and he was showing other pictures
to me. Nay, do not frown, Reuben,&#8221; she broke off, not
guessing that Billy&#8217;s name was unwelcome to the other
on more counts than one. &#8220;He knows the hedgerows
and the fields so well, and he showed me things as old
as the hills&mdash;things new and wonderful each spring&mdash;things
that come to you again each year, Reuben, with a
surprise that seems each year to grow fresher and more
eager.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he show you, Cilla?&#8221; asked the other
jealously, turning to cry &#8220;<i>Gobble-di-gobble-di-gobble</i>&#8221; to
the turkey-cock, and provoking a hot answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first wild-strawberry bloom, the first throstle&#8217;s
nest, the first April look of Sharprise Hill when the sun
slants on it through the clouds that mean no harm. Your
foreign lands grow misty, Reuben, somehow, and I love
Garth village once again. Billy had ever that trick&mdash;to
make you wise in spite of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben paced up and down in a restless way he had;
then he stopped and looked at Priscilla of the Good Intent,
and in his eyes there was the mischief of a partial truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those beyond-places will haunt you, Cilla, all the
same, and I could take you to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was silent for awhile, and then she drew her
lavender-blue skirt more closely round her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, so you could; but, Reuben, I prefer to stay at
Garth with father. I&#8217;ve enough to do in a day, and am
happy in it. Hark, ye! The throstle yonder is singing
his throat dry. Did ye ever hear sweeter music, Reuben?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>On the bench that fronted Elm Tree Inn sat Billy the
Fool meanwhile. He had waited, with his inimitable
faith and patience, for a fill of tobacco and a half-pint
of ale to drop from the skies; and his faith had been fulfilled,
for down the road from his forge came David the
Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looking sulky-like,&#8221; said David, laying his bag of
tools beside his crony and sitting near to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not I. I never look sulky, David. &#8217;Tis not good
for this right wholesome world to look sulky,&#8221; said Billy.
&#8220;I was thinking, David, and thinking makes a daft-witted
chap have fearsome aches and pains in his inward parts,
as a daft-witted chap might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>David gave out his big, rolling laugh as he clapped Billy
on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess what&#8217;s a-going wrong with thee, laddikins.
Empty pipe, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay. And I&#8217;m empty o&#8217; matches too,&#8221; said Billy, his
face like Sharprise Hill with the April look on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty in the low-ward parts, moreover,&#8221; he added,
after he had filled his rakish pipe and lit it. &#8220;I&#8217;m terrible
in need of a sup o&#8217; summat, David. Reuben Gaunt came
by this way awhile since and offered me what ye might
call body-warmth, and I couldn&#8217;t seem to stomach it&mdash;nay,
I couldn&#8217;t, David, not how he&#8217;d tried to pour it down
my windpipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt been down to the village to-day?&#8221; snapped
David. &#8220;Pretends to be a farmer, yet doesn&#8217;t go on
farmward shanks to Shepston market come Thursday
every week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the other slowly, as he pulled
eagerly at his pipe. &#8220;Mister Reuben Gaunt is not by
way of farming, as I look on and see ye busy folk a-farming,
like. Does it for play, like Billy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>David rarely lost his temper, and still more rarely did
he seek expression for his feelings in strong language; but
now he was silent for a moment, thinking of his love for
Priscilla, fearing Gaunt&#8217;s love of her; and a sudden cry
escaped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn Reuben Gaunt, and the first day he set eyes
on Garth again!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t swear, David,&#8221; put in the other slyly.
&#8220;Parson do say, whenever he stoops to talk to the likes o&#8217;
me, that folk who swear go to a fearful dry and overwarm
spot. He&#8217;s wiser than ye or me, is parson, David, and
we should listen to him, we.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he should tell us,&#8221; responded David grimly,
&#8220;why deep-set troubles come to a man, Billy, without his
earning them, and why a man must swear at times, or
else do something worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, &#8217;tis a terrible makeshift sort of a world&mdash;terrible
makeshift, David; but yet, in a manner of speaking and
as a body might say, ye understand, it suits Billy right
well. There&#8217;s always fields and hedgerows, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not till late, as Billy and he moved up the street
toward his forge, that a strange fancy came to David Blake.
He remembered, as a lad, the stir and gossip there had been
in Garth nigh twenty years ago. A company of strolling
players had come to Garth, had played there to wondering
rustics in the barn at the end of the village, and had gone
their way&mdash;all save one, who stayed behind and found her
way, late on a mirk and windy night, as far as Marshlands.
She was found dead at the gate of the homestead
on the morrow, and a four-year-old child was crying at her
side. None ever knew the rights of the tale; but old
Gaunt of Marshlands was known as the wildest roysterer
in the dale, and, though some disbelieved the story that
the woman had come to him for help and that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
deliberately turned her back, to die in the rain and cold,
yet all believed that Gaunt was father to the child.</p>

<p>The child was Billy the Fool, adopted and well cared
for by all Garth&mdash;a village bairn, the plaything and the
property of all kindly folk. And Reuben Gaunt was the
acknowledged son and heir to Marshlands.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis odd,&#8221; muttered David often and often, as he
worked at the anvil and glanced at Billy. For he remembered
the consistent hatred shown by the natural toward
Reuben Gaunt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">GHYLL FARM was in the parish of Garth, but it
lay so high on the moor-edge, and so far away from
the sheltered village, that it was reckoned out of bounds.
Moreover, Widow Mathewson, who lived there with her
daughter Peggy, was accounted something of a heathen
even in the charitable judgment of Garth folk.</p>

<p>These two, mother and daughter, lived alone at Ghyll,
doing their own farm work&mdash;even to scything of the one
small meadow when haytime came. They went never
at all to church or chapel; they were distant in their
greetings when they chanced at rare intervals to meet their
neighbours; they were pagan, self-reliant and alone,
and it was said that Peggy was wild as the widow, and
never a stiver to choose between them.</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson was at her door this morning,
watching the lambs play antics with their mothers in
the fields below. Big-boned she was, and tall, and her
face wore that lined, hard look of weather which women
rarely show.</p>

<p>She ceased to watch the lambs by and by, and her eyes
wandered to the track that led to Garth&mdash;the track that
glistened like a living thing beneath the April sun. Far
down the slope of the path a slight, dark speck appeared,
growing each moment till it showed itself as a man&#8217;s figure.
The man was walking fast, steep as the field-track was,
and Widow Mathewson laughed quietly when he came
near enough to show the eagerness of his every movement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>She left the doorway, and went and rested her arms on
the rail that guarded the potato-patch from the fields.
And she waited, with a look on her face such as David
Blake had worn, three days ago, when he swore outright
in the presence of daft-witted Billy.</p>

<p>The man was so full of his own thoughts that he did
not see Widow Mathewson until the path had brought
him to within a score of yards of her garden railing; and
then, for shame&#8217;s sake, he had to come forward with a
jauntiness that was obviously ill-assumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here to give you good day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After
five years, &#8217;tis only neighbourly to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re here to see Peggy, and know it, Reuben
Gaunt. We didn&#8217;t part such friends five years since that
you need come trying to smooth me down with lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt reddened, and flicked a hazel-switch uneasily
against his riding-breeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lies go terrible smooth into a woman&#8217;s ear when she
loves ye,&#8221; went on the other; &#8220;but they&#8217;re puffs o&#8217; wind
when she loathes the sight of a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find a deal of pleasant home-coming welcomes,&#8221;
said Gaunt, stung into bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not pleasant, ye see. Have to meet the weather,
we, and rear the crops. You may be Mr. Reuben Gaunt
of Marshlands, or you may be son to the devil that fathered
ye&mdash;&#8217;tis all one to me. I like a man, or I don&#8217;t, and I
never set eyes on one I liked less than ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be saying good morning, then,&#8221; said Reuben,
with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but ye won&#8217;t&mdash;not just yet awhile. Ye came
here to daften my lass Peggy again, so ye thought. Well,
ye&#8217;re here, as it chances, to listen to sense from Peggy&#8217;s
mother. It runs in our family, Reuben Gaunt, for the
women to love undersized and weakly men. We&#8217;re overstrong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
maybe, and must have some fretful babby or other
to dandle, same as big men like to do. Peggy&#8217;s father was
just such a one as you in his time, and I loved him. Ay,
I cried when I buried him, and I cry still o&#8217; nights sometimes
when I wake and find an empty bed. Yet I looked
down on him in life, Reuben Gaunt, as I look down on
you. Queer oddments go to make up a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, mother,&#8221; came Peggy&#8217;s low, rich voice.
She had returned from a haphazard scramble on the moor,
and had listened to half the talk with a simplicity that
came of pagan habits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go within doors, Peggy!&#8221; snapped her mother, turning
sharply. &#8220;D&#8217;ye want to catch the plague, or what,
that ye go breathing the same air as Reuben Gaunt?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Peggy did not move. Perhaps the closest bond between
these two, strong mother and strong daughter, was
the knowledge that they feared each other not at
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re made up of oddments, ye and me, mother. Ay,
&#8217;tis a good word, that. I happen to love Reuben Gaunt,
as you loved father once&mdash;and ye&#8217;d better just leave us
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson smiled on them both&mdash;a smile
that was bitter in its avowal of defeat, in its hapless faith
that what would be, would be, and that the would-be
must be bad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorrow along, Peggy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If ye choose to
strew your way with tears, &#8217;tis not I that ought to blame
you. Good night, Reuben Gaunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The quiet dignity of her farewell troubled Gaunt more
than all her previous outspokenness had done. He felt
like a country clown in the presence of a lady, and he
hated Widow Mathewson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, now, mother&#8217;s hard on ye, and always was,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
said Peggy, touching the man&#8217;s arm with a certain fierce
tenderness.</p>

<p>He answered nothing, and Peggy went through the
wicket, and moved slowly across the field, knowing that he
would follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to think the same, from what you said just
now,&#8221; he muttered, falling into step with her. He was
minded to return in dudgeon by the path which had
brought him up to Ghyll, but the girl&#8217;s pliable, trim look
disarmed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that I loved you, Reuben Gaunt. Whether I
trust ye or not and am a fool for all my pains to love
where I can&#8217;t place trust, is not for me to ask. Oh, pity
of me!&#8221; Her shoulders opened to the wind, and she
laughed at herself and him. &#8220;To have a mind to think
with, Reuben, and to live near to the fresh air and the
wind, and yet to let your heart go loving, spite of all.
I&#8217;ve trained a few dogs in my time, Reuben. Wish I could
give myself some wholesome thrashings, and be quit of
you for good and all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt was no fool, just as he was no wise man. It
seemed the wind had blown from the four quarters at one
time when he was born into a usually steady world.
He was no fool; and, though he smarted still from Widow
Mathewson&#8217;s contempt, he was quick enough to see that
Peggy had some special grievance of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s amiss, lass?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;This much is amiss&mdash;that now and then I find myself
in Garth, and now and then I hear gossip of Miss Good
Intent. She&#8217;s bonnie and slim to look at, I own, and worth
perhaps a score or two of you, Reuben; but I&#8217;m not concerned
with what she is or what she&#8217;s not&mdash;I&#8217;ve no
mind to share you with another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they saying, then, in Garth?&#8221; He stooped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
to pluck an early daisy, and Peggy&#8217;s mouth twitched with
a sort of scornful humour. Reuben Gaunt was not wont
to take a tender interest in wild flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are saying,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;that you&#8217;re seen
over-often with Priscilla Hirst; they say that you&#8217;ve a
look on your face, when with her, that they remember
from old days. <i>I</i> remember it, for that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to the little wood where water ran
between the budding hazels, where catkins yielded to the
fluttering wind. Reuben stopped, and put an arm about
her waist, and the remembered look was in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look ye, lass, and see if I am true or not,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Peggy laughed openly&mdash;it was her protest against this
renewed, yet long discarded, half-belief in him. &#8220;Miss
Good Intent has said no to you, eh?&#8221; she murmured,
with that bewildering frankness which attached to her
mother and herself. &#8220;Shame to come begging crumbs,
when you wanted something better.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew by his eyes that her guess was a true one, that
he had come, inconstant as the wind, to find one playground
when another was denied him. He was the same
Reuben Gaunt who five years since had all but broken
her courage and her heart. And, because he was the same,
she felt the old love return, and let her reason go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother is vastly right at times, Reuben,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis in our family to love a man o&#8217;er keenly, and to listen
to his lies, and to go on caring all the more. There&#8217;s one
thing puzzles me, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited, perplexed as he often was by women&#8217;s moods,
though by this time he ought to have known their every
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, only this, Reuben&#8221;&mdash;there was pathos in the
quietness of the deep, strong voice&mdash;&#8220;I was young and
unused to heartache when I found it first. I&#8217;m five years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
older, lad, and I&#8217;ve suffered and come through it. Seems
it has taught me little. Seems I might as well be weaker
than ye, instead of stronger. &#8217;Tis a bit of a muddle,
Reuben, this life o&#8217; wind and sun and turmoil.&#8221;</p>

<p>David the Smith, meanwhile, was walking up the lane
to Good Intent. He did not need to watch Yeoman Hirst
well out of Garth before he stole into the fold, for he was
welcome there at all times.</p>

<p>A desperate business David had on hand. He had
thought much of Priscilla of the Good Intent during these
last days; and this meant only that he had halted more
often in his work of smithying or what not to wonder how
the lass would best be made happy.</p>

<p>It was while he was sharpening a bill-hook on the grindstone
in his smithy-yard that David had got his adventure
well in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never thought of that before,&#8221; he said, running his
thumb along the blade. &#8220;I&#8217;m a rum chap enough, God
knows; but, if it comes to a tussle &#8217;twixt me and Reuben
Gaunt&mdash;well, I&#8217;m stronger in the thews than he, and
maybe I&#8217;m what ye call steadier-like.&#8221;</p>

<p>So David, with plain faith in plain strength of stronger
thews and steadier morals, laid down the bill-hook, and
bade his faithful comrade, Billy, to sleep on guard; and
he strode along the quiet street of Garth, and turned into
the lane that led to Good Intent.</p>

<p>He found Priscilla in the kitchen, her arms bared above
her elbows. She was making a pigeon pie for Farmer
Hirst, and David thought, as he saw her in the sunlight,
that no man need ask for a bonnier sight than Garth
could give him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve something to say to ye, Priscilla,&#8221; was his greeting.</p>

<p>David could never do any business save in his own way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
If he were driving a stake into the ground, he took up his
mallet and hit it plumb; if he were asked to shoe a horse,
he did not stay for talk, but brought the nag to reason
soon as he could and clapped the shoe on it. So now he
proposed, in great simplicity, to deal with this more desperate
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something to say?&#8221; laughed Cilla of the Good Intent.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis not often you have that, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not heed. If he had spoken out like this at that
gloaming tide when Priscilla had first waited for him to
speak, when Gaunt had shadowed the mistal-door, it
might have been better, or worse, for David; but now it
was too late. &#8220;The time of day was behind him,&#8221; as
they say in Garth, but he did not heed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve something to say,&#8221; he went on doggedly.
&#8220;When you were a lile slip of a lass, and when you were
maiden-grown and proud, Priscilla, I loved you just the
same. I&#8217;m busy to-day, Cilla, but I broke off to ask if
you would wed me. Could aught be plainer, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl rested her hands on the table, and looked at
David Blake. She was silent, for surprise had given way
to deeper feelings. It had been easy to disdain Reuben
Gaunt, when he came wooing at a few weeks&#8217; end; but
David&#8217;s love was a thing to be reckoned with, a big, protecting
force which had been about her for so long that
it seemed fixed and righteous as Sharprise Hill&mdash;a part
of this gracious world of Garth, a part of the comeliness
and peace which brooded over its grey old fells, its grey
and fragrant street.</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent had little in common with
Peggy Mathewson; but they were alike in this, that each
looked out at life with candour and with little coquetry.</p>

<p>Cilla glanced with troubled eyes at David&mdash;glanced
wistfully and anxiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;It cannot be, David; yet, if you asked me why, I
could not tell you. I know you love me. I know that
Garth would seem lone and empty if you were not in it.
What ails me, David? Tell me, and I&#8217;ll right it if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>But David the Smith knew nothing of such matters. He
had made his last effort&mdash;a hard one&mdash;and looked for a
plain answer, yes or no. Even yet, had he known how to
come nearer to the girl, instead of standing, very big
and very bashful as he swung from one foot to the other&mdash;even
yet he might have scattered those fantastic mists
which Reuben Gaunt had woven about Priscilla&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no two ways, Priscilla,&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;Either ye&#8217;ll have me and make life a different matter;
or ye won&#8217;t, and I&#8217;ll trust ye to find a likelier mate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not for mating&mdash;father has need of me&mdash;oh,
David, David, I&#8217;m so fond of you, so loth to hurt you.
Cannot you understand? I&#8217;m fond of you, but &#8217;tis not
just love&mdash;&#8217;tis not just love, David!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice was trembling, and she fingered restlessly the
loose scraps of dough that littered the baking-board.</p>

<p>David stood motionless. The boy&#8217;s look, that is in
every lover&#8217;s face, was gone. Not till now&mdash;now, when
he had greatly dared and greatly lost&mdash;did he fully know
what stake he had in Cilla&#8217;s love; and his face was hard
and stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were kind to hear me out, little lass,&#8221; he said
at last. &#8220;Ay, ye were always kind and comely. And
I&#8217;ve lost ye. Perhaps I may go on keeping watch and ward
about ye, as I always did? &#8217;Tis little I can do in that way,
but I&#8217;ve always liked to think I was watch-dog, like, ever
since as a child ye <i>would</i> loiter round about the pool in
Eller Beck, and I feared ye&#8217;d tumble in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, hush, David! You&#8217;ve been too good, and I am
not strong enough for Garth. I dream too many dreams&#8221;&mdash;with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
a pitiful attempt to smile&mdash;&#8220;and I&#8217;ve lost the
way of the love I might have had for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re at Good Intent, David&mdash;and welcome!&#8221;
shouted Yeoman Hirst, tramping in from the fields across
the threshold of the sunlit doorway.</p>

<p>It was a jest in Garth that John Hirst, though no way
deaf himself, fancied all other folk were so.</p>

<p>Priscilla dropped her eyes and took up the rolling-pin
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye,&#8221; said David, with a quietness that contrasted
oddly with the other&#8217;s roar. &#8220;Ay, I&#8217;m here passing
the time of day with Priscilla. I must be off by that token,
for there&#8217;s work crying out for me at the forge yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always was, so long as I remember. Outrageous
man to be doing somewhat, is David&mdash;fair outrageous.
Tuts! Ye&#8217;ll stay for a bite and sup with us? Cilla has a
pigeon pie in the making, I see. Always said, I, that a
pigeon pie served two good usages&mdash;keeps a lile lass out
of mischief while she&#8217;s making it, and keeps her men-folk
strong to work for her after they have eaten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>David shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve too much on hand, and
thank ye, farmer. Will come another day, if ye&#8217;re so
good as to think of naming it again. Good day, Priscilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a nod to them both he was off, and John Hirst
chuckled weightily. &#8220;Fair gluttonous for labour, eh,
Cilla?&#8221; he said. &#8220;David would do better if he took more
while-times o&#8217; rest, say I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was busier with her task than the time of day
demanded; and her father, getting no answer, came round
to her side of the table, and pinched her cheek, and
watched the dough of the pie-crust as she rolled it into
shape&mdash;watched with the eye of faith, and trusted it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
would be brown and wholesome by half-past twelve
o&#8217;clock, or thereby.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lile lass is busy, too,&#8221; he laughed, in what was
meant to be a gentle tone of raillery. &#8220;Busy with your
hands, Cilla&mdash;and busy awhile since with your eyes, I
reckon, when David came a-courting.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced up sharply, and again the farmer laughed,
as if a half-gale had got into his throat. &#8220;Nay, I overheard
nothing, Cilla,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I only looked at David&#8217;s
face, and I gathered ye&#8217;d said no. Second thoughts are
best, lile lass, second thoughts are best. Never saw a
properer man than David myself, and I&#8217;m reckoned a
judge of cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you measure human-folk by the ways of the kine,
father?&#8221; she said, fitting the dough to the edge of the
pie-bowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly&mdash;ay, mostly, Cilla. Chips of the old gnarled
tree o&#8217; life, are all us living folk, two legged or four.
Choose a likely lad, Cilla&mdash;and, for the Lord&#8217;s sake, get
that pie into the oven. Have been up the fields since
seven of the clock, and hunger&#8217;s timepiece says &#8217;tis dinner-hour,
or ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Hirst went out again, for he had a virile wisdom
and a knowledge of the time to leave a woman when he
had spoken truth to her.</p>

<p>David the Smith, meanwhile, had gone down the lane.
He could never wed Priscilla now&mdash;for Yea and Nay
seemed always absolute to him&mdash;but at least he had concealed
his heart-sickness from Yeoman Hirst. So do the
younger men think always, not understanding that with
age there comes a clearer understanding of the passions
which greybeards view as onlookers.</p>

<p>David was of the men who snatch their courage from
the thick of despair, ride out with it, and count it the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
precious because it is riddled through and through, like
a banner well baptized by fire. So he held his head high,
and swung staunchly down the lane.</p>

<p>Three usual folk he met as he came into Garth Street
and crossed to his smithy. They noted nothing out of the
common in his cheery greeting; but Billy, rousing himself
from sleep beside the smithy fire, knew by instinct
what his comrade&#8217;s humour was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re terrible gloomy, David the Smith,&#8221; he said,
as he stretched his idle shoulders. &#8220;What&#8217;s amiss with
us all, now spring&#8217;s come into Garth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Life,&#8221; snapped David, and picked up his tools,
abandoned for Priscilla&#8217;s sake. &#8220;Just life, Fool Billy, and
I&#8217;d no real quarrel with life, that I know of, before to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comes of being wise,&#8221; said the other tranquilly.
&#8220;Try being a Fool Billy&mdash;just try it, David, and lie
in a hedge-bottom when &#8217;tis seasonable, and hear the
chirrup o&#8217; the throstle. Begins to try his whistle, does
throstle-boy, before the dawn comes rightly in.&#8221;</p>

<p>David fingered his tools. They steadied him at all
times, and his patient love for them was returned in full,
at this moment of his direst sorrow. He felt his heart
grow lighter&mdash;less heavy, rather&mdash;as he handled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humming a tune, are you?&#8221; said Billy presently,
with an approving nod. &#8220;Terrible fool&#8217;s trick, that, and
comforting. Shows ye&#8217;re getting upsides wi&#8217; yourself, as
a body might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting upsides with myself?&#8221; growled David the
Smith. &#8220;Have got to do, or what&#8217;s the use o&#8217; life?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">RUMOUR was not less busy in Garth than elsewhere
where folk congregate, and Reuben Gaunt gave
food for it these days. His rules of conduct, or the lack
of them, were a constant puzzle; his wish to play the
gentleman, when by rights he should have been a yeoman,
and proud of the same, perplexed them; moreover, he
could be brave and generous on occasion, and this fitted
ill with their notions of a scamp.</p>

<p>Ne&#8217;er-do-wells, pure and simple, they could understand.
There were two or three of the breed in Garth, but these
consistently were idle at the best, and in dire mischief at
the worst.</p>

<p>Gaunt was a puzzle to them, and therefore a whetstone
for their tongues. Then, too, he was fond of horses,
and master of them; fond of dogs, and knowledgeable
as regards their ways; and these were qualities that Garth
village liked to see in any man.</p>

<p>Just now, indeed, it was his love of horseflesh that was
talked of most in Garth. They said that his patrimony
was rich, as a farming yeoman counted riches, but not
enough to let him hand over the direction of his lands to
a bailiff&mdash;as he had already done&mdash;while he himself
rode idly up and down the countryside, or followed race-meetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Galloping to the devil, eh, as many a lad has done
before him,&#8221; one would say to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay. Seems like as a horse is the best thing God ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
made&mdash;barring a good human-chap at his best,&#8221; the other
would answer; &#8220;yet a horse is the devil and all when ye
get a man o&#8217;er-fond of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another whisper was abroad in Garth, one remote
altogether from bankruptcy or horseflesh. They said
that Priscilla of the Good Intent was not herself of late, that
Reuben Gaunt was seen too often in her company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too good for the likes of you&mdash;eh, Silas Faweather?&#8221;
one would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, a mile and a half too good; but what&#8217;s to come
has got to come, and lasses are mostly fools i&#8217; the springtime
of their life. Not just such fools, I take it, come later
times, when the fairies&#8217; pranks are over with, and bairns
arrive, like, and a sackless husband still runs daft-wit,
following what he calls his pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla of the Good Intent knew her own mind as little,
this mid April time, as Gaunt himself. The man&#8217;s plausible,
deft homage when he met her; his seeming forgetfulness
of the day when he had wanted her to marry him, and
she had answered with a laugh; his low, quiet voice as he
talked of glamoured countries far away&mdash;all these were
fast making Reuben the centre of her thoughts. She
missed him if he failed to come, though she might draw
aloof and set a barrier between them when he did approach
her.</p>

<p>Yet David the Smith was about Garth Street each day,
and his nearness, though she did not guess as much,
steadied Priscilla. Beneath all else there was an assured
and pleasant liking for David, a dependence on his judgment,
a looking-out for him, as if her eyes needed shading
against the glare of life, when troubles came too thickly
on her. For this reason she seemed nowadays to play with
Reuben Gaunt, though she was wondering only what
her own heart had to say to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>News seldom travelled from Ghyll Farm to Garth.
The house lay so far up on the border of the moor, and
Widow Mathewson had discouraged intercourse so long,
that you might have travelled through the village, and
asked by the way for news of those at Ghyll, and yet have
learned no tidings at the end of all. Had the widow been
ill, or Peggy dying, days might well have passed before
they knew in Garth what had chanced at the lone and
churlish farmstead. So they guessed nothing nowadays
of Reuben&#8217;s new infatuation for Peggy Mathewson; had
they guessed it, Cilla of the Good Intent would have had a
whisper, kindly and wholesome, dropped into her ear.</p>

<p>She heard no rumour, would have disdained rumour had
she heard it. Clean of thought and heart, Priscilla wondered
if she loved Reuben Gaunt just well enough to marry
him. She never questioned his good faith. It was hers to
say no or yes&mdash;spoiled little queen of the little village
as she was&mdash;and she asked herself, over and over again,
with Puritan self-question, if this light of the glamoured
lands were not a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp such as danced across
the upland marshes. When she saw David, and spoke
with him, it was sure that marshlights flickered about her
fancied love for Gaunt. Then Reuben would come, soft
of speech and pliable, and David would seem a big and
country lad upon the sudden.</p>

<p>Spring, meanwhile, flushed into splendour round about
the gardens of Garth Street, and in the woods, and along
the length of mossy lane-banks. A foam of green-stuff
feathered the larches and the rowans, the dog-rose bushes
and the blackthorns. The low, sequestered dingle hiding
Eller Beck was banked so thick with primroses on either
side that it seemed a thousand golden eyes looked up,
winking the dew away, when farm-folk went through the
dene at blithe of the dawning-time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The weather held, with playful showers that were like
a child&#8217;s tears, gusty and soon over. Seldom in the memory
of Garth had the pomp and circumstance of the young
summer proceeded with so few mischances. There had
been no sudden snow to hinder the lambs new-dropped
about the pastures; there had been no frost o&#8217; nights; and
the throstles sang their clarion note as if no winter&#8217;s wind
had ever piped a harsher tune about the grey fell-village.</p>

<p>At eight of one of these spring mornings&mdash;the wind
light from the south, and the sun playing bo-peep with
fleecy clouds&mdash;Priscilla of the Good Intent stood waiting
under the elm tree which long ago had given its name to the
village inn. She had been fitful lately in her temper, and
Yeoman Hirst, thinking a day&#8217;s holiday would be &#8220;good
for the lile lass,&#8221; had asked her to carry out some farming
business for him at Keta&#8217;s Well, high up the valley.</p>

<p>So Cilla waited, a trim and slender figure, near the old
elm tree. The public vehicle by which the Dales folk
went from Shepston to Keta&#8217;s Well&mdash;a vehicle half coach,
half omnibus&mdash;halted here to take up passengers. The
coach was overdue, as it happened, and while she waited,
Priscilla saw Reuben Gaunt ride down the street.</p>

<p>Reuben saw her, too, but pretended that his mare was
fidgeting upon the rein. He pulled her sharply back at the
entry to the stable-yard, plucked her forward again, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not see me,&#8221; murmured Priscilla of the Good
Intent. &#8220;Light to come and light to go, is Reuben Gaunt,
they say&mdash;but surely&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt had found the ostler in the inn-yard. &#8220;Dick,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;has the coach gone by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, sir. She&#8217;s late this morning, like, and that&#8217;s
rare for Will the Driver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the nag in the stable, Dick, and look well after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
her. I had forgotten that the coach went up this hour
to Keta&#8217;s Well. Better drive than ride, eh, when there&#8217;s
a long way to travel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true. Better be carried than suit your
knee-grip to a horse&#8217;s whimsies,&#8221; laughed the other, turning
his straw from the left to the right side of his
mouth.</p>

<p>Reuben strolled out into the highway. Not slow at
any time, he had guessed, seeing Priscilla standing under
the old elm with a basket in her hands, that she was waiting
for the coach; and, though awhile since he had been
sure that he meant to ride to a pigeon-match three miles
away, he was certain now that he must go to Keta&#8217;s Well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, Priscilla,&#8221; he said, with quiet surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day,&#8221; she answered, the wild-rose coming to
her cheeks. &#8220;You did not see me, Mr. Gaunt, when you
rode into the inn-yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ready lie came to Reuben&#8217;s tongue. Like water
slipping down between the ferny streamways of the hills,
he sought only the quiet pools&mdash;sought them at any
hazard of the rocks that met his course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared I had lost the coach, Priscilla, and was riding
hard to catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wild-rose crimsoned into June in Cilla&#8217;s face. &#8220;Are
you going, too, to Keta&#8217;s Well?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve business there. And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve business, too. Father is busy in the fields, and has
asked me to do some bargaining for him up yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too bonnie and slim-to-see for bargaining,
Cilla,&#8221; said Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; she laughed, with frank disdain of flattery.
&#8220;I can bargain well, Mr. Gaunt, when needs must. Ask
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The irony of life rose up and laughed at her, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
midst of this hearty springtime weather. If ever she had
needed a hard heart and a clear knowledge of what barter
meant, she needed them now. She had a great gift to
bestow, or to withhold&mdash;the gift which lies in the hand
of every woman once in a lifetime&mdash;and yet the spring,
and Gaunt&#8217;s whimsical, gay air, bewildered all her judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always flout me nowadays, Cilla,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Gaunt was strangely like the dogs he loved so well.
Careless of the past, careless of the future, he longed always
for the instant pleasure, and, if he were thwarted,
assumed a helpless face of innocence. It seemed that the
sense of guilt was left out of him at birth; thwartings by
the way surprised him, when another man would have
admitted that he got no more than his deserts.</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent, also, was strangely like
herself this morning. She remembered that her father,
and all the men-folk of Garth, were hard on Reuben.
She looked at his devil-may-care and pleading face, and
decided impulsively that they were wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not flout you willingly,&#8221; she answered, her candid
eyes looking straight into Reuben&#8217;s own. &#8220;They are
not fair to you in Garth here, and I am sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Across their talk came the patter of horse-hoofs, and
the coach swung merrily round the corner and stopped
with a flourish at the inn-door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Miss Priscilla!&#8221; said Will the Driver,
lifting his whip with a brave salute. Cilla of the Good
Intent was his favourite passenger, and he had seen her,
with the quick eye of friendship, as soon as he had turned
the corner.</p>

<p>He got down to help the ostler with the buckets; for his
team of three were mettled horses, and Garth was the
baiting-stage on their journey up to Keta&#8217;s Well, and Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
would never admit that the business could be rightly done
unless he bore a hand in it himself.</p>

<p>There were seats for eight at the top of the coach, but
Reuben Gaunt, though all were empty this morning, did
not choose to sit beside the driver. He handed Priscilla,
by way of the yellow-painted wheel, into the rearmost
seat and clambered up beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on horseback this morning, Mr. Gaunt?&#8221; said
the driver, who had a word for every one and knew each
dalesman&#8217;s habits.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s good in changing, Will,&#8221; laughed the
other, &#8220;if &#8217;tis only out of one coat into another. A fine
spring morning, this, for sitting on a seat instead of on
the top of a horse&#8217;s temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, my cattle, too, are feeling young Spring come
back into their bones. Terrible wild to handle this morning,
Mr. Gaunt. You&#8217;ll soon be up at Keta&#8217;s Well, I
fancy.&#8221; He gathered the reins into his hands, looked
round with a cheery nod to the knot of idlers gathered
about the inn, and was starting forward when Widow
Lister ran crying down the highroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Will! Nay, lad, you surely wouldn&#8217;t have gone
and left my bit of a basket behind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was I to know you were coming?&#8221; said Will,
pulling up and surveying the woman&#8217;s apple-red face&mdash;a
face brimming over just now with jollity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should&#8217;st have guessed,&#8221; she went on briskly. &#8220;And
me a lone widow, too&mdash;and to have run myself all out o&#8217;
breath at my age, just to catch a young man who does
naught for his living save sit on a seat and let himself
be carried.&#8221;</p>

<p>A placid titter went up from the onlookers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; cried Will the Driver. &#8220;Hand up your basket,
Widow! Where must I set it down?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;There! Not to guess a simple matter like that! Ye&#8217;ve
to leave it at the first stile on your right after you&#8217;ve passed
through Rakesgill. Mrs. Fletcher it&#8217;s for, and she&#8217;s wiser
than you were a minute since, Will, for she knows it&#8217;s
coming. Oh, and Will,&#8221; she added, her red cheeks
dimpling with roguery, &#8220;it goes from one poor body to
another, does this bit of a basket, and happen ye wouldn&#8217;t
charge for it at either end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; said Will. &#8220;Want me to take it as
my own private baggage, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only some roots of double-daisy in it, and a
few plants of auricula, and a little, round Garth cheese.
Mrs. Fletcher&#8217;s fond, as you might say, of flowers and
cheese; &#8217;tis all by way of a present to another lone widow
woman&mdash;and she my own sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some folk thrive on loneliness, &#8217;twould seem,&#8221; laughed
Will, putting the basket under the seat. &#8220;All right,
Widow! I&#8217;ll leave it on the stile, and we&#8217;ll trust to Robin
Goodfellow to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started forward, got his team into the straight, then
turned round to Cilla. &#8220;By your leave, Miss Priscilla,
there&#8217;s some of your sex have longish tongues. I&#8217;m proud
of being to time, and here we&#8217;ve wasted five whole minutes.
No man likes bringing cattle home in a lather, but these
beauties will have to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll stand it, Will,&#8221; said Gaunt. &#8220;Never met a
man myself who could better get a horse into shape and
keep it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will the Driver showed what his team could do. Like
a true dalesman, he was proud of his own trade, and Gaunt
had found a sure way to his ear. Between the white and
sunlit limestone walls they swung, and between hedgerows
where the bird-cherry showed its glossy leaves. Little,
tinkling streams flew by them; and, up above the roadway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
hedges or the roadway walls, the clean, sweet fells raked
forward to the blue and fleecy sky.</p>

<p>To Priscilla it was a journey into the outskirts of that
Beyond which tempted and enthralled her. The sunshine,
the quick going of the coach, the deft, quiet interest
which her companion aroused&mdash;all helped to round off
this adventure into the heart of spring. They stopped
at Rakesgill, to set down the scanty mail and a few odd
packages, and to take up a passenger on the box seat.
As at Garth, the villagers had met to see the mail-coach
in, and Cilla watched the group, and listened to their
banter, with a sense that the freshness of the growing
year was blowing round their old-time jests.</p>

<p>Widow Fletcher was waiting at the stile&mdash;the first on
their right hand as they trotted out of Rakesgill&mdash;and it
was plain, from her red, plump cheeks and her cheery
air, that she was own sister to Widow Lister of Garth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to pay?&#8221; she asked, as she took the basket
into her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Widows thrive well in these parts, and wear the
luck of the rowan-berry in their cheeks,&#8221; said Will, flicking
his whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comes of losing men-folk&#8217;s company, Will&mdash;though
thank ye for the basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men-folk are always wrong, &#8217;twould seem, Widow
Fletcher. Came of listening to a woman in those far-off
Bible-times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, Adam blamed Eve, and Eve&#8217;s been blaming
Adam ever since. So we&#8217;re quits, Driver Will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tongues are longer than time,&#8221; said Will, with a happy
laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve naught to do with Eve and Adam, Widow,
but I have to be at Keta&#8217;s Well come twelve o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a man,&#8221; said the widow to herself, as she watched
the coach go swiftly in the van of the light, smooth April<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
dust. &#8220;Like a man, to be worsted by a lone widow&#8217;s
tongue, and then to flick his horses up and drive away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver checked his team again, a mile further up
the road, to take another parcel from underneath the roomy
driving-seat. This he laid on the top of a gate that opened
on a farm-track.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a ham for farmer Joyce, Miss Priscilla,&#8221; he
said, with the trick he had of laughing over his shoulder
at passengers behind. &#8220;Seems he&#8217;s not just hungry, yet,
or he&#8217;d be here for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; said Cilla, as they rattled forward, &#8220;it
is odd that you should be going to Keta&#8217;s Well to-day.
I go so seldom, and you would be riding, surely, if you
were not lazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to know my business there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why should I need to know it? Perhaps you
are going to buy another horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you my business on the way home, Cilla,
because then I&#8217;ll know whether it is speeding well or
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla&#8217;s eyes rested lightly on his, then danced away to
the grey, far hills. The girl was a madcap this morning,
and deserved to be; for she had many working days, but
enjoyed few spendthrift days of holiday, with a green world
and warm spring winds about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;For my part, I have
father&#8217;s work to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a flourish, as if he carried great personages&mdash;Will
was never so happy as when driving Cilla of the Good
Intent&mdash;the coach drew up at Keta&#8217;s Well. There was
an inn on the left hand of the grey, wide roadway, another
on the right, and the two were so friendly, as it chanced,
that Will baited and took his dinner at either hostelry
upon alternate days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Priscilla took Gaunt&#8217;s hand daintily, and clambered
down into the roadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;We say good-by here?&#8221; she murmured, with a
shy flush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;until Will is ready to drive
us home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet &#8217;tis only a good walk to Garth for one as strong
as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am lazy to-day, Cilla, as you told me. You go on
your business, I on mine. Remember that the mail goes
back at five o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men all said it was a devil&#8217;s trick of Gaunt&#8217;s to
know just when to stay and when to leave; the women,
most of them, found the trick praiseworthy; and Reuben,
had you asked him, would have laughed, like the man-child
he was, and have said that he deserved neither praise nor
blame, since he was as the good God had made him. At
any rate, he had judged wisely now in guessing that Priscilla
would shrink from sharing a meal with him.</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent dined sparingly at the inn
on the left hand of the road, where the landlady mothered
her always after a brisk, impersonal fashion. Reuben
dined at leisure in the right-hand inn, and sauntered out
a half-hour after Cilla&mdash;punctilious always, even in the
midst of a holiday, when business was to be done&mdash;had
crossed the street and walked up into the grey bridle-way
that sought the fell-top farms.</p>

<p>When Gaunt came out at last, he wandered up the
fields. He had found business here at Keta&#8217;s Well, and
his business was to think of Priscilla and to long for her.
He saw the rathe-ripe primroses shine out at him from
sheltered dingles, and he gathered a likely bunch. They
were cool and fragrant, and he thought again of Cilla.
The larks sang overhead, and the sad, wild curlews shrilled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
wide about the fields their song of destiny. And now from
a watered hollow, as he passed it, a heron clattered noisily
from among the trees; and again, as he looked up some
dancing streamway, a kingfisher would dart, with a flash
of blue that startled him, across the sunlight; and everywhere
upon the hills the sheep were bleating happily,
calling the lambs to the udders.</p>

<p>Few dalesmen could have withstood a day which seemed
to hold, in the hollow of the quiet sky&#8217;s arch, all that was
lusty, and good to hear and see, and sweet to smell. This
was the land&#8217;s answer to those who said that her winter-time
was bleak and bitter; and out from some forgotten
Eden the west wind seemed to blow.</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt withstood few pleasures at any time, and
now he swung completely into friendship with this land
which no remembrance of other countries could ever
belittle to him. He felt again the throb of boyhood, of
boyhood&#8217;s keen, unspoiled delights. Good impulses rose
and carried healing with them. For this one day he was a
good man in his own eyes, and that boded ill for Priscilla,
who was going sedately about her business, moving
from farm to farm with a lightness and a happy zest in
holidaying which suggested something of the kingfisher.</p>

<p>Gaunt roved the fells, the primitive, strong motherhood
of nature crying constantly to him from the pastured
slopes, where big and little dots of white against the green
showed fine sheep-harvests for the farmer-folk. His
heart was big and clean&mdash;for this one day&mdash;and he
thought of Cilla, and she seemed the brave, sweet symbol
of this vale of Garth.</p>

<p>He thought, too, of Peggy Mathewson, living wide
yonder of Garth village and likely wanting him beside her
at this moment. He shook the thought away, and prided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
himself, God help him, on finding the better man in himself
to-day.</p>

<p>Another thought he had&mdash;repentance for his sins&mdash;and
this boded ill again for Cilla of the Good Intent. Repentance
heretofore, with Reuben, had been a bird that
laid her eggs in another&#8217;s nest, and left her young to turn
out the foster-mother&#8217;s offspring.</p>

<p>The larks were shrilling about him. A peewit circled,
dropped, and fell, not five yards from him as he stood
motionless in dreamland; the bird looked shyly once at
him, then dropped her plumed head and went on feeding
placidly. So still the man was that a lamb, new-born and
guileless, came bleating to inquire what manner of thing
he was; and the old ewe-mother ran, forgetting that by
nature she was timid, and butted Reuben with a quiet,
yet warlike pressure.</p>

<p>He woke from his dream, and gave the ewe a playful
kick. &#8220;Look to your own married life,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;as
I am hoping to look to mine before the year is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the sun, and guessed that it was after
four. Repentance and memory of Peggy Mathewson
slipped from him. He strode down the fields; and, short-statured
as he was, and slight of build, he carried a look
of bigness with him. It was Reuben&#8217;s holiday, as it was
Priscilla&#8217;s. The sun shone on him, just or unjust, and
he stood apart from himself and his past, and felt that
the good love and the strong love were his to ask and
take.</p>

<p>Priscilla, waiting for the coach, and just five minutes
before her time, as her wont was, was surprised by Gaunt&#8217;s
straight, forthright air as he crossed the street of Keta&#8217;s
Well. She had never seen him in the light with which this
witching day of April glamoured all the land. Every man
was better than he guessed to-day, and every woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
comelier; and down the breeze played Puck the Sprite,
laughing at all wayfarers as he laid the cobwebs on their
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How has your business sped, Cilla?&#8221; asked Reuben,
lucky as he always was in being five minutes before his
time, instead of five minutes after.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered, lifting the eyes of truth to his.
&#8220;And yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, also, Cilla. I have found what I came to Keta&#8217;s
Well to seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>They plighted their troth&mdash;neither altogether understanding
the long glance&mdash;there in the grey road of
Keta&#8217;s Well. Reuben&#8217;s eyes caught honesty from Cilla&#8217;s,
and she thought the mirror truthful; and, by and by, Will
the Driver came thundering down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to time, in spite of women&#8217;s tongues,&#8221; he laughed,
pulling up his team. &#8220;Lord help us drivers, Miss Priscilla,
for we suffer much from women&#8217;s tongues. Widow
Fletcher will be waiting for me, too, on the homeward road,
if I know her, for &#8217;tis her twice-a-day time to crack talk
with Will the Driver.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt spoke little on the homeward journey, and Priscilla
was strangely silent, too. Passengers climbed up
into the coach, or scrambled down, but these two heeded
little of what went on about them. There were stoppages,
at this hamlet and at that, to take up the mails which Will
stuffed into the sack that grew bulkier and bulkier as
they went along. From hill-top farmsteads lasses ran
down, bareheaded and cleanly outlined against the background
of the fells, to give Will another letter for his sack,
or another parcel to be hidden underneath the box seat.
All was life and movement on the Garth highroad, but
two who travelled on it were thinking altogether of each
other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;I gathered these primrose blooms for you, Cilla,&#8221; said
Reuben, breaking one of their long silences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that your business, then, in Keta&#8217;s Well?&#8221; The
girl&#8217;s laugh was low and happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him with that wild-bird look which her
father had noted and distrusted weeks ago. Then she
looked out again at the fell-tops and the pastures, which
swung past on either hand in wide half-circles. The magical,
blue sunset-time was spreading light fingers already
about the hills and dimpled fields.</p>

<p>Gaunt did not know himself. Good thoughts came to
him like a mystery as deep as this veil of evening that was
clothing all the land. For this one day he loved Priscilla
as a better man might do; he lacked only the courage to
be true to another, at any hazard of his present happiness.
For Reuben Gaunt had never learned, or had never cared
to learn, that honesty is ever and ever like the tight, grey
walls of Garth valley&mdash;foundationed well, well built, and
proof against the winds of winter-tide. He loved Priscilla;
that was all; and good love, for the moment, was
his pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I guessed I should see you here, Widow Fletcher,&#8221;
the driver&#8217;s voice broke in. &#8220;What can I do for you this
time, in a littlish way?&#8221;</p>

<p>The plump-cheeked woman was standing at the gate
as if she had never left it since the morning. She was
laughing, too, as if her face had kept its dimples all the
day&mdash;a guess that came near to truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I only want you to take the basket back. Lone
widows are lone widows, aren&#8217;t they, Will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, and there&#8217;s a plague of them about, &#8217;twould
seem. They swarm like bees in June about this
road to Garth. Terrible pranksome cattle, widows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
horses, and terrible hard to deal with,&#8221; retorted the
driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re lonely, Will, though. Widows are always
sorrowful and lonely. You&#8217;re thinking of charging for the
carry of this basket home to Garth? Men-folk were always
selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will laughed, as Priscilla&#8217;s father might have laughed,
giving innocent villagers the notion that thunder was
springing from a clear and fleecy sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m selfish this way, Widow Fletcher&mdash;that I&#8217;ve
only a minute more to waste in talk. Hand up your basket.
&#8217;Tis just another trifle to the load.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Fletcher let the team start forward, after giving
the basket into safe keeping; then ran down the road with
an agility surprising for her years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will! Will the Driver!&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>He pulled up with a sort of weary haste. &#8220;Ay?&#8221; he
asked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be passing here to-morrow? Well, you might
just call at Mason&#8217;s little shop in Garth and bring me a
half-pound of tea. There&#8217;s number three painted on the
canister, Will&mdash;but Mason will know the number, if you
say &#8217;tis for me. Poor widows need their comforts in this
life, and tea soothes a body, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will started forward in earnest this time, and addressed
the empty road in front of him, where the leafing hedge
on the right hand was casting plumper shadows than it
had thrown since last its twigs were bare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Runs in the family,&#8221; he said, flicking an early fly from
the leader&#8217;s back. &#8220;Widow Fletcher here, and Widow
Lister yonder at Garth&mdash;they always want you to do
something for them, and always ask you to do it after
you&#8217;ve fairly started. There&#8217;s a trade in widowdom up
hereabouts, I fancy. Gee-up, Captain, will ye?&#8221; he broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
off, touching the leader more sharply with his whip.
&#8220;You were born of the male kind, Captain, and so was I,
and we&#8217;ve got to make up for lost time &#8217;twixt here and
Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla, shall we get down this side of the village?&#8221;
said Gaunt suddenly. &#8220;We&#8217;re nearing Willow Beck Bar,
and &#8217;tis summerlike for a saunter home by the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla looked again at the fells, and smelt the sweet of
the breeze as it passed her. It was three miles from the
grey little toll-house to Good Intent, and there was a
suggestion of mystery and adventure in this finish to a
holiday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she answered simply, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seven packages
with me, but Will will see that they get safe to Good
Intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>They got down at the squat, quiet toll-bar, with its
windows fronting, like a bee&#8217;s eyes, on all sides of its face.
They went through the gate together, and Will the Driver
watched them for a moment as they turned into the path
that followed the slight stream&#8217;s course.</p>

<p>&#8220;See her parcels safely &#8217;livered at Good Intent?&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;Would do more for the lile lass, I. Pity
she seems so friendly-like with Mr. Gaunt. Should keep
to dogs and horses, Mr. Gaunt&mdash;he understands &#8217;em.
Now, Captain, <i>will</i> you know I&#8217;m late on the road, and
trust to you to make the whole team work?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY followed the winding stream-track, Gaunt and
Cilla of the Good Intent. And now it was that the
day, receding in the west, grew beautiful as it had never
been at height of noon. Strange purples shadowed all the
distant fells, while near at hand the pasture-fields moved
in green, tranquil softness to the heath above.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quiet, Cilla,&#8221; said the other by and by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet? I was listening to the curlews.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not the words, but the girl&#8217;s low, passionate voice told
what the curlews meant to her. Now, when the silences
crept, dumb of feet, all down the furrows of the land, it
was the curlews only that were loud. Wide about Sharprise
Hill they called, and along the raking backs of Hilda Fell,
and across and over the ordered lines of grey walls, green
fields, and scanty woods that were Garth Valley. They
would not let folks rest, but went crying, crying, fretting,
fretting, while Sharprise wore his ruddy sunset-mantle,
and Garth Crag, away to the east, was donning her grey
night-cap.</p>

<p>Garth folk, when they are compelled to be far away
from home, remember always how the curlews fret and cry
about the fells. The sob in the bird&#8217;s call&mdash;the sadness
that begins so quietly, and afterwards goes shuddering
out across the gloaming&#8217;s stillness&mdash;they are the interpreters
of music, sad enough, but understood and loved.
In the daytime, complaining of the sheep; near dusk, the
curlew&#8217;s melancholy; folk who have known and heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
these things will lie o&#8217; nights amid the welter of the tropics,
and call the clear sounds back to mind. Reuben Gaunt,
random as he was, had done the same, and Cilla&#8217;s earnestness
came home to him to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re sad birds, though, when all is said,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sad? Ay, and so is life, or was meant to be, if we
could only see it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla&mdash;whether the curlews had caused her this
dismay, or not&mdash;felt restless, ill at ease, as if the light
of some great truth were coming to her, and her eyes were
unprepared for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, listen, lile lass!&#8221; said Gaunt. He was helping
her to cross a strip of marshy field, and his grasp tightened
on her arm. &#8220;Suppose life was meant just otherwise?
Suppose there was love of a man for a maid, and the lark
singing up to the sun?&#8221;</p>

<p>The candour in her eyes bewildered Reuben for a moment,
as she freed herself and sprang lightly to the drier
ground, and stood facing him, her hands clasped in front
of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if it <i>were</i> love, Reuben.&#8221; She was no longer
proud, or self-secure. It was rather as if she reached out
in search of guidance, feeling the throb of new, quick
impulses, as if she asked Gaunt to tell her, out of his riper
wisdom, whether it were good or ill to follow these same
impulses.</p>

<p>There was flattery in this to Reuben. He felt big, protective,
and again he yielded to a half-truth&mdash;that Cilla
had shown him the good way of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lile lass,&#8221; he said&mdash;and Garth Valley knows no
softer endearment than those words&mdash;&#8220;lile lass, must I
be asking you again and again to marry me? Cilla, I love
you, and I could house you well.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>She thrust her clasped hands outward, as if to ward off an
evil thought. &#8220;What does the house matter, Reuben?&#8221;
she said, with another gust of that passion which few
suspected in Cilla of the Good Intent. &#8220;D&#8217;ye think I
would wed for house and gear? I&#8217;m asking, Reuben,
whether love is going to sit on the hearthstone and keep
it warm&mdash;if love is going to sit at meat with us&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try, and see, Cilla,&#8221; he broke in quietly.</p>

<p>More magical, and still more magical, the gloaming
deepened over the patient fields. Sharprise Hill was a
clear-cut wedge of purple now, pointing up into an amber
sky, and Hilda Fell showed as a dark blue, jagged line,
with a tuft of crimson cloud lying over it like the tattered
banner of day&#8217;s defeated armies. Low and roving wide,
deep and tremulous, the curlew&#8217;s voice went round and
about the pastures, telling, it seemed to-night, that two
human-folk were drifting on life&#8217;s glamour-tide, telling,
too, of the mysteries, the tumult, and the pains which
lay ahead.</p>

<p>They had been silent, awed by the kindred silence of
the eventide, the subtle uproar of the curlews, awed by the
gift that had come to each of them. On the sudden
Reuben Gaunt set his arms about the girl, and drew her
to him; and Cilla of the Good Intent, not knowing why,
lay there and did not heed. And then again, not knowing
why, she stood away, and her face was pitiful to see, because
she tried to check her sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, lile lass, you&#8217;re crying!&#8221; cried Gaunt, awakening
from his happiness.</p>

<p>At all times brave, at all times candid as the sky, Priscilla
checked her tears, but not the sobs just yet. &#8220;I was
never kissed before&mdash;and, Reuben&mdash;all my pride is
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed openly. He would never learn how like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
a child was Cilla, how like a braver woman, too, than he
deserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I ask to wed you, Cilla?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the old life is gone, and I fear the new one.
I was never one to fear&mdash;yet now&mdash;Reuben, you&#8217;ll be
kind and true? I can never give my heart at twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask you to, lile lass,&#8221; he answered cheerily.
&#8220;Once is good enough for me, seeing you&#8217;ve chosen
Reuben Gaunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another silence fell on them, broken only by the low
complaining of the curlews. Then Cilla, smiling and
sobbing both, looked Reuben in the face again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be no time to be afraid? Tell me again &#8217;tis
happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To our lives&#8217; end,&#8221; said Gaunt, and meant it at the
moment.</p>

<p>They were nearing the track to Good Intent, and their
footsteps lagged. The Beyond, which Cilla had thought
to lie out and away behind the fells, had come to Garth,
it seemed, to-night; for each detail of this homely land she
knew from childhood took on a warm, new aspect. This
was her first love-time, and life held unsuspected melodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla,&#8221; whispered Gaunt, &#8220;you&#8217;re making a new
man of me. You&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He halted in his speech, and the girl, had she glanced
at him, would have seen perplexity and helpless anger in
his face; but she was looking ahead with dreamy eyes&mdash;looking
so far ahead that she scarcely saw the strapping
lass, limber and well-featured, who was coming up the
stream-track.</p>

<p>Gaunt had seen her, though, and was asking himself
why Peggy Mathewson had chosen this one hour for a
saunter up the waterside. As they drew near his anger
changed to fear; for Peggy was apt to be outspoken, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
might ruin with a word this new and better life which,
to his fancy, opened out before him.</p>

<p>Banned by Garth village as she was, there was no man
in it who could say that this lass from Dene Farm was
anything but comely; more than one, indeed, had sought
her company, in a diffident and non-committal way, to
the anger of their womenfolk. Yet Peggy had never shown
her beauty to the full, as she did now in the moment of
her tribulation. She had seen Gaunt before he was aware
that she was near, and had needed no second glance
to convince her that a lover and his lass came wandering
down the stream; and, having lived a country life, she
knew that there was no way of dealing with a nettle save
to grasp it. For that reason she straightened her firm,
tall body&mdash;which had drooped a little because, until
she turned the bend of the stream, she had been thinking
kindly thoughts of Reuben&mdash;and she moved up the
stream as if she were over-lady of Garth Valley.</p>

<p>To Gaunt&#8217;s surprise she took no heed of him, but
stayed to pass the time of day with Cilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spring&#8217;s here at last, after the long winter,&#8221; she said,
in the rich voice that even now moved Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here at last, Peggy,&#8221; answered Priscilla, who banned
no one, child or man or woman, whatever folk might say
of them. &#8220;You&#8217;ve chosen the best time of day for your
saunter, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely I have,&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;I&#8217;m courtship-high,
Miss Priscilla, as they say in Garth, and my lad
waits me somewhere up the stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I wish you happiness,&#8221; said Cilla, out of
the warmth of her own glamour-tide. &#8220;&#8217;Twill be no
secret soon, Peggy, that Mr. Gaunt here wants me to
marry him some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla rarely stayed to measure the wisdom of her words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and never when her heart was glad, because then, of all
times, it was right to give sunshine out.</p>

<p>Peggy Mathewson winced, recovered as from a blow,
and turned to Gaunt with an impassive face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did not see you before, Mr. Gaunt. Miss Priscilla
here wears such a look of spring about her that a plain
body seems to want to see no farther, like. You might
have chosen worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a nod to Priscilla she went her way, and Cilla
turned to look after her and to admire the bold, free swing
of limbs and body.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something whimsical about her, Reuben.
Yet why they give the Mathewsons so bad a name, I could
never guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said the other lamely.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not as though they did aught amiss, save live
outlandishly away from Garth and show little care for
company. They&#8217;re an odd couple, mother and daughter
both; but they carry themselves as if they had a pride in
life, and even father owns that they know how to treat
their cattle and how to rake the hay-crop in. That&#8217;s much
for father to say, who thinks that women&#8217;s place is in the
dairy and the house-place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of you, Cilla,&#8221; broke in Reuben desperately.
&#8220;Why spoil the night with talk of Peggy Mathewson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I know not. The girl has always puzzled me. I
could have liked her, and been friendly, Reuben, but she
seems always like the east wind, that will be friends with
none.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy herself, meanwhile, had carried her aching heart
till she was sure of being out of sight. Then she stumbled
to the nearest gate, and looked out at the grey, soft darkening
of the hills. Sharprise was an ill-defined, blue-purple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
splash across the fell-scape now, and the curlew&#8217;s
note waned softer and more soft.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas to be,&#8221; murmured Peggy. &#8220;Oh, ay, &#8217;twas
like as it was to be. The queer thing is, that I bear no
malice to slim Miss Good Intent. Should hate her, I&mdash;yet,
if &#8217;twere not she, &#8217;twould be another.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke as if half stunned; for, though her judgment
had foreseen such trouble long ago, her heart had covered
up its doubts. She, too, heard the wailing farewell of the
curlews to the twilight; but it reminded her only of sad
weather on the moor&mdash;of wet east winds, with snow behind
them, just when the lambing season seemed like to
prosper&mdash;of frosty labour in the fields of barren harvests.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll break my life in two. Tried hard to, once, did
Reuben Gaunt; and now he&#8217;s home-returned to finish
off the brave job, &#8217;twould seem.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gathered the remnants of her courage together.
With a pitiful defiance she laughed, though a sob broke
half-way through the laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kept my pride to the end. Told Miss Good Intent
I went to meet my lad. Oh, I know Reuben! He&#8217;ll think
of that in a while, and grow jealous.&mdash;Pity o&#8217; life!&#8221; she
broke off, straightening herself with sudden passion and
flinging out her capable, strong arms with a gesture that
was tragic in its impotence. &#8220;Women keep crying, crying
out to God&mdash;if there is one&mdash;and asking why men were
sent into the world for mischief. And no answer comes,
not if you mucky your knees with going down in the peat
to pray for &#8217;t. And women go on saying there&#8217;s no such
thing as heart-break; and men believe &#8217;em, because they
daren&#8217;t do otherwise; and graves keep being dug, and
good lives shovelled under &#8217;em, with a word or two from
parson to smooth the sods down. Lord, I wish a few o&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the surpliced folk would come to Peggy Mathewson for
guidance!&#8221;</p>

<p>The last silence of the fells came down about the girl.
Yet she stood there, not thinking much, but feeling more
than weaker folk could have borne. So quiet it grew that
the busy travels of the field mice could be heard, as they
pattered through the grass, and the nestling of the lambs
against their mother&#8217;s fleece was a call, almost, across the
stillness of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew all along, and I wouldn&#8217;t heed,&#8221; she whispered
to the night. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t heed again, if all were to be
done afresh. Yet what he&#8217;s missed! God, what the lad
has missed!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PRISCILLA had forgotten Peggy Mathewson soon
after they had passed her by. She was thinking
of Reuben, sauntering step by step beside her, and of
the new elusive joy there was in these April gloaming-tides
which she remembered from her childhood.</p>

<p>As in all joy, there was a corner somewhere, unswept
by the cool evening breeze, which harboured distrust of
happiness. It was not Reuben she distrusted&mdash;for she
was one of the brave, simple kind who, once loving, are
hard to move from faith; it was belief in God&#8217;s ulterior
harshness, which is the cold refuge of the weak: it was
a doubt of the reality of what she felt, a looking out toward
something steadier and more calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Troubled still?&#8221; asked Gaunt, recovering quickly
from the shock of meeting Peggy, now the danger of it
was over for the present.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems too good, that is all,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>And then he talked to her, as they moved through the
quiet after-light and neared the stile that brought them to
the croft of Good Intent. He put his love, his hopes
of a finer life, his resolutions for the future days, into
words that would have moved a harder and more clear-sighted
maid than Cilla. He talked once more of foreign
lands, and again of this sweet Garth that lay about them,
and he twined his love of Cilla throughout it all like a
golden thread.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>Priscilla forgot that dark corner where vague distrust
span webs like a spider in a dusky room. Out of her heart
she gave her love to Gaunt; and, because her heart was
full, she needs must laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben, we&#8217;ve not told father yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but will do soon. What&#8217;s the thought in your
bonnie head, Cilla?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that I must wash my face, for I&#8217;ve been crying.
Father is never so tired o&#8217; nights but he looks at me at
home-coming, and he seems to know if an eyelash lies out
of its own proper place.&#8221;</p>

<p>This side the stile, where they had halted, there was a
well-spring for the cattle&mdash;a trough of stone, all but
hidden long since by the mosses and the ferns that fed
greedily upon the water. Priscilla dipped her kerchief
in, and washed her face, and dipped the kerchief in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; she said demurely, when she was satisfied
that all the stains of the night&#8217;s tumult were removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but not so quietly, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she reached up her face to him; and then he said
he would wait till she was safely home, for even the home-croft
held dangers when you loved a maid. And Priscilla
tripped happily across the grey-dark grass, and, because
she was happy, she turned at the bend of the mistal-yard
and hooted like a barn-owl, to let Reuben know that she
was safe.</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed as he turned home about. He did not
follow the wandering line of the stream this time, but took
a straight course across the fields&mdash;a course that led him,
as it chanced, to the gate over which Peggy Mathewson
was leaning, still fighting despair as best she might. Her
back was turned to him, but even in the dim light Gaunt
could not mistake the figure; he bit his lip impatiently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and wondered if he should pass on and climb the wall
a little further up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, she would know, though she won&#8217;t seem to see
me now,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Best have it out, and have done
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved quietly to the gate, and laid a hand on her
arm. &#8220;Peggy&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>She swept his hand away, and turned on him, and
Reuben Gaunt, who had seen mainly the softer side of
women until now, was awed by the storm that broke about
him. She said little; but in her voice, in every movement
of her body, there was contempt and loathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get you home!&#8221; she cried, pointing across the grey
haze of the fields. &#8220;Get home to your kennel, Reuben
Gaunt. D&#8217;ye think I want such as you to come touching
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, lass&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and <i>but, lass</i> and <i>but, lass</i>&mdash;and you want to
explain, and explain&mdash;fool Reuben, haven&#8217;t I learned
your tricks and your wheedlesome ways by this time?
Little Miss Good Intent is younger to &#8217;em. Come out
of your kennel to-morn, and talk to her; <i>she&#8217;ll</i> believe ye,
maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d best not part in anger,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we? &#8217;Tis the only way we are like to part.
I&#8217;m waiting for my lad, as I told Miss Priscilla just now.
He&#8217;ll <i>explain</i> to ye, Reuben Gaunt, if that&#8217;s what lies in
your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suggestion of physical cowardice&mdash;not true of
him at any time&mdash;stung Gaunt as much as anything
the girl had said or left unsaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, I&#8217;ll wait for him here with you, Peggy,&#8221;
he said, holding his ground.</p>

<p>For a moment she relented. Gaunt was always showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
her glimpses of a certain hardihood of courage which she
liked to see in man or woman. Then she remembered
Cilla, and saw again the look those two had worn as they
came down the fields to meet her&mdash;came whispering,
hand in hand, as if they robbed no woman of her
birthright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done with you, Reuben
Gaunt, and you with me, and &#8217;twill be a far day and
an ill day that brings me within speaking length of you
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you like,&#8221; he said doggedly. &#8220;I only wanted
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, to explain! Reuben, I&#8217;m too old to your tricks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tiredness and the scorn of those last words left
Gaunt no choice. Without a word, he set a hand on the
top bar of the gate, vaulted it, and passed out into the
greyness of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;He should end that way,&#8221; said Peggy, looking after
him. &#8220;Sometimes he&#8217;ll take a three-barred gate too many,
all in his easy style, and light on his head the further
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tired out with passion, wearied of scorn, she turned to
wander up the stream. And she met her lad, and walked
with him; and he was known by the name of heart-break
to the few who believe in such old-world superstitions.</p>

<p>Cilla of the Good Intent, meanwhile, after crossing the
croft in safely and giving her owl&#8217;s call to Reuben, had
gone indoors. Yeoman Hirst was sitting by the fire&mdash;it
was rarely so warm in Garth, but what a fire o&#8217; nights was
pleasant&mdash;and he was nursing a long clay pipe in his
hand. He had been counting his gains in live stock during
this wonderful propitious lambing-time; but he looked
up quickly as Priscilla entered, and in his glance there was
that close-seated affection which proved Cilla right when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
she had said that &#8220;father would know if an eyelash lay
out of its own proper place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look&#8217;st brave and well, Cilla!&#8221; was his greeting.
&#8220;Got the wind to your cheeks, eh? Now, I do begin to
think, spite o&#8217; being your father, that you&#8217;ve some claim
to winsomeness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was not so happy as she had been a moment
since. This steady warmth of greeting seemed out of
keeping with the quick, random happiness she had seized
by stealth to-night. It had in it something of the security
she had missed in Reuben&#8217;s wooing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, shame to go spoiling your own lass, father!&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;And see, you have no horn of ale beside you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not like to have till you come to fill it. I must be
getting old and daft, Cilla, for I cannot rightly taste the
wholesome bitter in my evening draught, unless you come
and fill it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She busied herself to fill the horn from the cask of October
ale which stood in the outer kitchen. In outward
seeming she was the same Cilla as of old&mdash;capable and
gentle, wholesome to look at, and careful of a good
man&#8217;s wants; yet until now she had never known what it
meant to hold any but a trifling secret from her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sit ye down, Cilla,&#8221; said Hirst, after a quiet pull
at his ale. &#8220;Sit ye down, and tell me all about your day
at Keta&#8217;s Well. I&#8217;m in good humour, lass. Been thinking,
lass, while you tarried shamefully, that never was such
a lambing-time in Garth. These Scotch ewes are bonnie
to see&mdash;like &#8217;em best of all, for my part&mdash;but they seldom
drop two lambs. Seems there&#8217;s a fairy-wand about,
Cilla. I go to bed o&#8217; night, and hear the lark whistle me
up next morning, and go up the pastures, like&mdash;and there&#8217;s
another ewe twinned lambs. The lan&#8217;s fair white wi&#8217;
the wee beasties.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>It was Priscilla&#8217;s unrest that answered, and the words
slipped from her unawares. &#8220;You&#8217;re boasting in April,
father, and I&#8217;ve heard that wise folk never boast till May
is out&mdash;and seldom then.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer ran his hand along the arm of his high-backed
chair, in token of his faith that touching wood
was a sure antidote to pride. &#8220;There, you&#8217;re a lile, trim
farmer&#8217;s wife already, Cilla!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you
trust even such a weather-time as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla thought of to-night&#8217;s wooing weather, of how
little, after all, she trusted it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a foot of snow
in May, father,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>Hirst gave out that thunder laugh of his that rattled
the pewter on the shelves. &#8220;Oh, and have you, maid?
How many, then, has your father seen? Never get older
that way myself, Cilla&mdash;sure as heartsome weather comes,
I believe in &#8217;t like a brother. There may come a storm
in May enough to ding the house-walls in, but, come the
next soft May, ye&#8217;ll find me like a lad again, thinking the
sweetstuffs will never end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He filled his pipe afresh, then kindled it with one of
the paper spills which Cilla took from the mantel-shelf
and lit for him at the wide hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;David is late,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Promised to be here by
now, to talk over a matter of some wheel-axles I want from
him, and to join me in a pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David? Is David coming to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was surprised by her own terror of David&#8217;s coming.
To hold a secret from her father was ill enough, but
to meet David, just to-night&mdash;she could not bear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, it seems he&#8217;s not,&#8221; the other answered drily,
&#8220;or he&#8217;d have been here by now, surely. So you&#8217;ve had
your frolic, lass, at Keta&#8217;s Well. And your packages all
came up before you, with a message from Will the Driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that you were following on. Likely pranks, these&mdash;you
finished the day with a gossip, eh? Your mother was the
best soul that ever lived, but she aye relished a gossip,
I remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla had taken up some knitting, and bent her head
under the pretence that she had dropped a stitch. Her
father&#8217;s trust in her, his kindly banter, the old home
look of everything, were each a separate reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I walked from Willow Beck Bar, father. The evening
was so still, and the look of the quiet fields tempted me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would have tempted me, too. So long as you picked
up no gallant on the road&mdash;but there, that&#8217;s not your
way, lile lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>David, meanwhile, had not forgotten his promise to
Hirst; but on his way to keep it he found himself a half-hour
before his time, and, meeting Billy in the fields, had
good-humouredly joined him in a saunter.</p>

<p>David, as he went up and down the fields with his boon
comrade, had a feigned interest at first in the nests which
Billy showed him; for he was thinking of Priscilla. But
by and by his interest awoke; he saw the blackbird&#8217;s
dappled clutch of five, and the wise throstle looking at him
as she sat brooding, and the hedge-sparrow&#8217;s ragged nest,
built in the kink of a grey limestone wall and bottomed
with blue eggs; and he felt his boyhood return to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s a wren a-sitting over across yond field,&#8221;
said Billy. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t ye come with a body, David, and
see yon same?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another day, Billy, another day. I&#8217;m due with Farmer
Hirst, and must be getting back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, a body must turn when he must turn.
There&#8217;s no denying that, David. I&#8217;m going to see the
little shy bird a-sitting myself, so I&#8217;ll bid ye good e&#8217;en.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy the Fool was moving away, after the loose easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
way he had of carrying his great body, when he felt a lack
of something, and stopped and turned about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t a fill o&#8217; baccy on ye, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, lad&mdash;three, if ye&#8217;ll take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I&#8217;m only wanting one,&#8221; said the other, briskly
filling his pipe. &#8220;And a match, as a body&#8217;s body might
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lit his pipe, nodded tranquilly at David, then went
up the fields. David watched his unhurried stride, the
unhurried trail of smoke that drifted in his wake.</p>

<p>&#8220;A born smoker, is the lad. Puffs none too fast and
none too slow, but fair as if he had &#8217;twixt this and Judgment
to finish a pipeful in. No wonder Billy needs only
a match at a time; yond pipeful will burn its way till
there isn&#8217;t a strand o&#8217; baccy left in &#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>In some dim way, David Blake was awakening nowadays
from that bluntness and reserve which, even toward
himself, it had been his habit to maintain. In part he
was vastly diffident, and in part his days were filled with
earnest labour, so that all his life he had feared to indulge
in what he named &#8220;fancy feelings.&#8221; Yet to-night, as he
saw the utter content of Billy the Fool, he was moved to a
speculation which, before the spring came in, he would
have counted dreaminess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will die a lad, yond Fool Billy,&#8221; he muttered, as the
summing up of all his thoughts. &#8220;He&#8217;s the only man of
his age in Garth that&#8217;s what ye might call rightly happy.
Has no worries, he, and can make a wise fool like myself
see ladhood pictured all afresh in a clutch of blackbird
eggs. Would swop places with Billy, I rather fancy, if
the chance were gi&#8217;en me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a last look at the evening hills, the evening
fields, behind him; and for the first time he wondered
if Priscilla&#8217;s refusal of his suit were final. Greatly brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
in speculation was David to-night, and the mere hope
that Cilla might find second thoughts&mdash;a hope slender as a
reed, but real for all that&mdash;set a new light in his eyes
and a brisker movement in his feet as he stepped out
toward Good Intent.</p>

<p>He went on the high ground overlooking Willow Beck,
and as he walked he kept looking constantly into the
valley. So gently the gloaming filtered down the valley&#8217;s
length like a wide stream of silver-grey&mdash;so prayerful
and so still the evening was&mdash;that a man of harder heart
than David might well have found his eyes go seeking
peace and finding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s bonnie, when all&#8217;s said, is Garth Valley,&#8221; was
his thought; &#8220;and here am I, all late for Farmer Hirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted, though wishing to get forward.
Through the silver-grey of Garth Valley two figures came;
as yet they were no more than outlined against the grey,
but David was held by some unhappy intuition, and he
needs must stay and watch them at a nearer distance.</p>

<p>Slow, but pitiably sure for David, their progress was;
and soon, though it was too far to know their faces, he
knew them by their carriage and their walk. Spring was
over in a moment for David, but boyhood was not altogether
past, it seemed, for he felt his throat grow big,
and his eyes were smarting.</p>

<p>Once, as he watched them, they stopped, came closer
still together, and went on again; and over David&mdash;whom
folk thought slow and cheery, not given to feeling
overmuch&mdash;there passed the bitterness of death.</p>

<p>It was no selfish love he had for Cilla. To see any man
so close to the lile lass, whom he had watched over so long,
would have been a grief, because he frankly sought her for
himself these days; but had the man been honest, clean
of his hands, David would have felt no bitterness, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
a self-sorrow that he would not have nursed for long,
because such sickliness was foreign to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If&#8217;t had been any one but Gaunt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;any one
in all Garth village save Reuben Gaunt! Lord knows
I hate the willowy slim way of the man, and he&#8217;ll send
Priscilla&#8217;s happiness abroad&mdash;ay, will he, like any ladkin
blowing bubbles for a frolic on his mother&#8217;s doorstep.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away, and he thought that he could not bear
to go to Good Intent to-night. Yet he had promised, and
David&#8217;s word, till now, had been good as Queen&#8217;s coin
in Garth village.</p>

<p>Up and down the fields he wandered. If Cilla were not
sure to meet him at Good Intent, he could have gone at
once, and covered up his bitterness from Farmer Hirst
as best he might; but it was nearing dark, and he knew
that she would return before the last of nightfall came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot bear to see the lile good lass, and never speak
a warning word!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Out of the silence presently there came a cry&mdash;Priscilla&#8217;s
call to Gaunt, in token that she had crossed the
home-croft in safety&mdash;and David bent an ear and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a daft old barn-owl,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Birds
and their ways, and maids and their ways&mdash;I&#8217;m weary
of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was unlike himself, and knew it. It was well
for growing lads to be peevish at these times, but he was
old enough, he had fancied, to have learned some common
sense. So he squared his shoulders; and his face, in the
gathering dusk, wore the look he had when he was driving
a stake into the ground or was hammering a horseshoe
on the anvil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Promises run down the wind, they
say, and catch in any hedgerow&mdash;but not David&#8217;s promises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to Farmer Hirst. Bless me, and there&#8217;s a letter in
my pocket all the while, and I&#8217;d forgotten it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He set out in earnest this time for Good Intent, not
heeding the beauty of the grey night; and he came to the
wicket-gate that opened on the garden at the rear of the
farmstead, and went down the five steps leading to the
door, and knocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step in, David!&#8221; sounded Hirst&#8217;s big voice. &#8220;I
knew you&#8217;d come, lad, though I said you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>David the Smith opened and went in; and he felt himself
forlorn, seeing the look of things within doors. On
one side the hearth, with its back to him, was the hooded
chair in which the farmer took his ease at nights; and a
rough-coated elbow showing round the corner of the
oak, a haze of blue smoke curling up toward the rafters,
witnessed to Hirst&#8217;s presence. On the other side, facing
David, as he entered, sat Priscilla, her work on her lap,
her eyes on the fire that threw quiet, homely patches of
ruddy light and sombre shadow round about the room.
The farm-dog, Fanny, stretched at full length beside the
fender, was too full of dreams to do aught save wag her
tail in a feeble way, though she knew that one of her oldest
friends had come.</p>

<p>It was home, thought David; no subtle detail was wanting
to complete this picture of fair prosperity and honest
ease and fellowship&mdash;no detail lacking to save David an
added pang. He had been content, till lately, with his
work, his freedom, his trim little house with its garden
sloping down to the stream; to-night he saw only the
warm look of Good Intent, and by contrast his life seemed
barren and unprofitable. He longed for a lass of his own,
and a dog stretched half the length of the ingle-nook, and
maybe the cry of a bairn as it waked in its mother&#8217;s arms
and fell asleep again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;Come forrard, lad!&#8221; cried the farmer, getting himself
out of his chair with a cheerful groan&mdash;for he was stiff
after the long day&#8217;s work. &#8220;None so welcome at Good
Intent, come late or early. Fanny,&#8221; he broke off, stirring
the dog with his foot, &#8220;wilt get thy great body under settle,
thou jade, and let a better than thee draw up a chair?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog stretched herself, gave a low &#8220;yeow-ow&#8221; of
protest, looked up at Yeoman Hirst to learn if he were in
earnest. Seeing he was, she turned to David, and put her
fore paws on his chest and licked his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay!&#8221; said he. &#8220;What sort of guest would
David be, lass, if he let thee wheedle him after the master
had said <i>under</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny had liquid eyes, of a shade and lustre that any
woman might have owned to the shaming of her sisters;
she lifted them now to David&#8217;s, in between the patient
licking of his face, with surprise that he should turn the
cold shoulder to a friend in this way. So it ended&mdash;seeing
the man&#8217;s heart was soft and foolish toward all dumb
things&mdash;in David&#8217;s bringing a chair up to the hearth, in
his taking the dog&#8217;s brown-black, wistful head into his
hands and stroking her muzzle softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on thee, David!&#8221; laughed Hirst. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
be all spoiled by to-morn, when I want her to drive up
the sheep into the moor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll chance it, Farmer! Ay, we&#8217;ll chance it. Like
to feel a dog&#8217;s head in my hands, I&mdash;seems to hearten
a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that he had met his trouble, had seen Priscilla
face to face and conquered the outward signs of heartache,
David was almost merry. It had been a desperate venture,
this of meeting Cilla so soon; and, now that he was
in the thick of it, he felt something of the glow and mad-wit
gaiety which attends on great adventures.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Never had Cilla guessed till now that David Blake
could be so light of talk. The sobriety, nearing dulness,
which she associated with him was gone. Keen, quick
lights of humour played about his face. He had stories
at command&mdash;droll tales which Will the Driver had told
him of the road, sly anecdotes concerning the foibles of
his neighbour-folk. He was guarding a heartache bravely,
was David.</p>

<p>Once, in the pause of talk, he looked at Cilla, and found
her eyes resting on him with strange intentness. She was
thinking that the helping hand-grip she had sought not
long ago, when she resisted and yet longed for Gaunt&#8217;s caresses,
was David&#8217;s own. And, when she saw that he had
caught the glance, and was trying to read it, she took up
her sewing, and hoped the colour in her cheeks would be
counted to the firelight&#8217;s credit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Cilla, I&#8217;ve a horn of ale beside me, and David
here has none!&#8221; said the farmer abruptly. &#8220;Where are
your manners, lass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, now, take no trouble,&#8221; protested David. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
a pipe betwixt my teeth, Farmer, and what more should
a man want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble is as it&#8217;s taken, David. If ye go forth from
Good Intent without a something good and mellow in your
inwards&mdash;why, bless me, there&#8217;s no cheer left in Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was glad of the excuse to put her sewing down
and busy herself with David&#8217;s comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you to your talk, father,&#8221; she said, after
making sure that the farm&#8217;s hospitality&mdash;cherished for
three centuries or more&mdash;was no way shamed to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but come back to lay a trifle of cheese, and cake,
and oat-bread on the table. Have supped once already,
I, and so has David, likely; but strong work comes strong
to victuals, Cilla, at the second asking.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PRISCILLA gave some fleeting answer, and was gone.
Up the stone stairway she went, and into the chamber
beside the apple-tree, which, grown sturdy, was putting
out green springtime leaves. A slim, white sickle moon
lay helpless on her back&mdash;lighting in a softened fashion
Garth&#8217;s fragrant valley. Through the opened casement
the tempered April wind was fretting, as it blew the muslin
blind aside. It was a night when fairies played about the
land, when human ears, not deaf to all romance, heard
music fluting through the dull world&#8217;s uproar.</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent leaned her two arms on
the window-seat, and looked out upon the vagueness of
the landscape lit by the young moon. She was thinking
of her surrender to Reuben Gaunt, and wondering if
she were happy in her choice; and always as she asked
the question&mdash;pretending to herself that she asked it
not at all&mdash;David&#8217;s shadow stole in between herself and
happiness.</p>

<p>Gaunt himself about the same hour was standing on the
threshold of his own house of Marshlands. He had turned
the loose silver in his pocket on seeing the new moon, as
superstition bade him, and had prayed for luck. He had
tried, moreover, to think constantly of Cilla, but had
thought instead of Peggy Mathewson, and of the lad she
hoped to meet by the winding-path of Willow Beck.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Peggy, when she had planted that retreating arrow in
Reuben Gaunt, had judged wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must see her once more to-morrow,&#8221; murmured Gaunt.
&#8220;Must tell Peggy that new times have come in, and
old ones gone&mdash;but who, in the deuce&#8217;s name, is the lad
she means to take to nowadays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben is true at heart,&#8221; murmured Cilla, as she
watched Garth Valley, grey under the sickle moon. &#8220;They
wrong him, these Garth folk; he only wants love and a
helping hand, and I have promised to give both.&#8221;</p>

<p>David, below stairs, was talking with John Hirst, while
both sent up clouds of smoke toward the rafter-beams.
They had settled the matter of the axles, and Hirst was
chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish ye&#8217;d come up to-morrow&#8217;s evening, David. Yond
turkeys of mine are not penned up yet, and &#8217;t has grown
to be a jest in Garth. What with being throng with the
lambs, and cutting a new ditch in Marshy Field bottom,
and all the spring work coming faster than I can deal
with, I&#8217;ve no time to think o&#8217; turkeys. The stakes ye
made for me are lying just where ye left &#8217;em, and they
say in Garth&mdash;ay, pretty well every time I go down
street&mdash;that the pen will be nice and ready for next
year&#8217;s breeding-season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis time they were penned, Farmer, I own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time? I should think it was. Look ye, David, be
up at five o&#8217; the afternoon or so. There&#8217;ll be myself and
my two men, and with you to help we should get the durned
thing up in no time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! Yond red-wattled dandy &#8217;ull be fair uproarious,
I reckon, when once his wings are clipped.
Wakes the whole village as &#8217;tis.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent, puffing quietly at their pipes, till
David remembered the letter lying in his pocket and began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
to fumble for it among the odds and ends&mdash;nails and
screws, a clasp-knife and a two-foot rule&mdash;which bulged
his pocket out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want your knowledgeable sort of head to help me,
Farmer,&#8221; he said, handing the letter across Fanny&#8217;s curly
hide. &#8220;Will the Driver brought the mails this morning,
but I little fancied he carried aught for me, till the postman
dropped a letter for me at the smithy. Write few letters
myself, and get few; life&#8217;s over-short for such thankless
waste o&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst read the letter through. &#8220;Come all the way from
Canada, &#8217;twould seem,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;And I should
know the writer&#8217;s name, though I&#8217;m puzzled to guess
where and when I last saw Joanna West.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgotten my mother&#8217;s sister, have ye, who wedded
Joshua West of High Lands? So had I, or nearly, seeing
&#8217;tis twenty year since they left Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I must be getting past my memory, David! A
bonnie lass she was, and spirited. I remember looking
her way as a lad, till Cilla&#8217;s mother put all such fool&#8217;s
nonsense out of my head for good and all! She was over-good
for Joshua West, all the same. Bird of a feather, he,
with Reuben Gaunt&mdash;settled to naught, liked spending
money better than the earning of it; wanted to be pretty-boy-rover
over all the countryside.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was silent for awhile. Mention of Gaunt brought
sharply to him the remembrance of what he had seen to-night,
when looking down from the higher fields on the
grey of the valley&#8217;s gloaming. He wanted to warn Cilla&#8217;s
father, as he had wanted to warn the girl herself; but,
for the like reason, he held his peace; for Gaunt was his
rival, and David was sensitive almost to absurdity when
honour was in case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; he answered at last. &#8220;He was feather-bird<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to Gaunt. Lost his money and his lands, Farmer, ye
remember, and went overseas to see if he could frame
better, like? Framed well, too, as it proved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They sometimes do. I remember you told me, years
ago, that he was farming to some purpose at last, and was
earning gear and gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Puzzles me, too, why that should be. Is&#8217;t that Joshua
West&#8217;s sort o&#8217; breed cannot rightly stand against Garth
weather, with its ups and downs, and its east wind in
May, and its heartsome, daft contrariness? Or is it that
there&#8217;s fewer wayside drinks to be had in foreign parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bit o&#8217; both, I reckon. Well, then, he&#8217;s dead, by what
the letter says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay. Slipped under a timber-waggon, he&mdash;Joshua
was always fond o&#8217; slipping one way or another&mdash;and
they picked him up with his back cut in two. My Aunt
Joanna has not favoured me overmuch with letters, but
she&#8217;s in trouble now. Life&#8217;s always playing that queer game
with me, Farmer; when folk are up and about, damned
if they care a stiver for David the Smith&mdash;but when
they&#8217;re down, &#8217;tis always I&#8217;m their best friend, and must
hurry off at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up or down, folk look to ye, David,&#8221; said the other,
with unabashed and honest praise. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re a bit like
Sharprise Hill, ye&mdash;Garth folk <i>will</i> turn for a look at ye,
come evil times or good, before they step indoors o&#8217; night.
So Joanna West, having no sons of her own, is lonely over
yonder, now her good man&#8217;s gone, and she wants ye to
go out and set things straight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it. Yet Garth Village is good enough
for me, and always was. What make of moonshine would
it be to go marlaking in overseas parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221; said Hirst slowly. &#8220;We&#8217;re
talking no secrets, David, when I tell ye that ye want my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Cilla, and that I want ye to have the lass, though I can ill
spare her. Well, now, maids are pranksome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; assented David, his face ruddier than its
wont. &#8220;No news that, Farmer. Perhaps, in a littlish way,
ye&#8217;d let me ask what bearing the matter has on Aunt
Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst took his pipe-stem in his hand and waved it to
and fro, with a chuckle intended to be low. &#8220;Like ye!
Always like yourself, David. Hit life on the head with a
hammer, ye, and never stop to dither round about the
nail-top. What has Cilla to do with this letter coming
overseas? Well, &#8217;tis this way, David. When I was
courting Cilla&#8217;s mother, there were ups and downs&mdash;more
downs than ups, so far as I remember. The bonniest
lass in the world, David, but I couldn&#8217;t get near her
anyway; like a mare she was, when you try and catch her
in the paddock, and she looks at you out of the corner
of her bonnie brown een, and says, &#8216;Catch me if you can.&#8217;
What, short of baccy, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, and thank ye; but I&#8217;m listening, Farmer, and
my pipe may rest awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there came a day when I couldn&#8217;t bide it any
longer. She was not for John Hirst, I fancied, and the
devil came gripping the reins of me. &#8216;Priscilla,&#8217; said
I, going up to her father&#8217;s farmstead one summer&#8217;s gloaming
and chancing to find her in the garden&mdash;&#8216;Priscilla,&#8217;
says I, &#8216;I&#8217;m going forth from Garth.&#8217; And she looked at
me. I can see the look yet, David, though the poor lass
is lying under Garth kirkyard to-night. &#8216;How far are
you going, John, from Garth?&#8217; said she. &#8216;Oh, a world
and a half away,&#8217; says I, as jaunty as may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I meant all I said, for I couldn&#8217;t bide to live
in Garth unless I got Priscilla for wife&mdash;mother and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
daughter of the one name, ye&#8217;ll notice, David, for &#8217;tis
a name I love, and smells of double stocks and pansies.
&#8216;A world and a half away,&#8217; says I. And Cilla&#8217;s mother
fell to crying, same as her heart would break; and I
cuddled her to me, David, and I mind to this day that a
yellow-legged bumble-bee got up from the arabis flowers
and boomed across our faces as we kissed one the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to catch your drift, Farmer,&#8221; said
David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time you did, David! Mind ye, there&#8217;s no two women
like each other in this world. Men-folk are plain this and
that, more oft than not, and easy &#8217;tis to reckon up their
substance and their shape; but women are teasy-like,
and I&#8217;m no way for advising ye, David the Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye think I&#8217;d better go overseas?&#8221; said David slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ye&#8217;d better tell Cilla ye&#8217;re going, anyhow, and
see how the lile lass takes it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had David not halted to-night to look down from the
hills into the grey valley, he might have welcomed Yeoman
Hirst&#8217;s advice; but, so far as his leaving Garth affected
his chances with Priscilla, he harboured no false
hopes. Cilla was not one to walk lightly in the fields with
any man, and it was sure that her choice had fallen, once
for all, on Reuben Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not for me,&#8221; said the smith, looking straight
and bravely into Hirst&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts! Where&#8217;s your pluck, David? Put a bit of the
devil into that honesty of thine, lad, for all women like
a touch of keen sauce to their victuals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s devil enough in me nowadays, and thank ye&mdash;rather
too much for my liking. Truth is, my temper&#8217;s
breaking, Farmer, and breaking badly. Like an ill-forged
bit of metal it is&mdash;breaks if ye hit it gently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I know&mdash;I know, David, lad!&#8221; put in the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
with the wise, tolerant smile of age. &#8220;Bless me, &#8217;tis a few
odd years since the first man went daft-wit over the first
woman, and there&#8217;s been other-some in your place, David,
in the in-between years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go, anyway,&#8221; said David by and by. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
bide still in Garth as things are. Yet how I&#8217;m going to
live without Garth street, and the forge, and the fields
running up to the moor&mdash;I cannot guess. &#8217;Twill be a
wrench when it comes, for sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, &#8217;tis not for a lifetime, supposing Cilla lets
ye go&mdash;which, mind ye, I don&#8217;t believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door at the stairway foot was opened suddenly.
Priscilla had left her watching of the moonlight and her
thoughts of Reuben Gaunt to come down and spread the
supper-board. Her tread was light at all times, and the
two men were so intent on their talk that they heard nothing
until the rattle of the door-sneck warned them.</p>

<p>Yeoman Hirst prided himself on taking any situation
by the horns at a moment&#8217;s notice. So now he laughed,
setting the roof quivering again, and, &#8220;David,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;you&#8217;re full of droll tales to-night. Pity that Cilla did
not come before to hear yond last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla knew her father&#8217;s diplomacy, and guessed at once
that they had been talking of her. Her self-command had
in it some of David&#8217;s quality; perplexed as she was by
her constant wish to ask David&#8217;s help, bewildered by
the glamour-web that Gaunt had spun about her, she
gave no sign of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;David is merry to-night, father,&#8221; she answered quietly,
and went into the outer kitchen to fetch the supper things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, my word, he&#8217;s merry!&#8221; muttered David ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mustn&#8217;t let her guess that ye and me are as thick as
thieves,&#8221; said Hirst, subduing his voice with hardship.
&#8220;Love&#8217;s as good as lost, David, when a lass knows her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
father wants the lad as much as she. Must run contrary,
these maids, or else there&#8217;s no frolic in&#8217;t. I&#8217;d have their
fathers choose their lasses&#8217; mates, for my part; but they&#8217;d
rather seek counsel from the first beggar coming to the door
to ask for scraps.&#8221;</p>

<p>After supper&mdash;a quiet, unrestful meal to-night&mdash;David
got up to say farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou&#8217;lt open to him, Cilla?&#8221; cried the farmer, feigning
to be stiffer in the joints than the day&#8217;s work warranted.
&#8220;Old bones are old bones, choose how you try to prove
them young.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla rose gravely, and opened the inner door; then
went out into the porch, and stood looking at the crisp,
clean night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have troubled you,&#8221; said David awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no trouble, David; and yet, in other ways, you
make great trouble for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, how&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked, surprised into putting
his hand on hers and drawing her into the roadway. &#8220;David
make trouble for the lile lass? &#8217;Twas not wont to be,
Priscilla, before new times came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this way, David. You ask too much, and I cannot
make a friend of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems a pity, lass, for a better friend you never had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, but wilt be just a friend, David? One I
could come to, and ask for help?&#8221;</p>

<p>David looked at her. The moon and the stars were
tender with her face, and with her slim and upright body.
Cilla had always been the one maid for him, but to-night
there was magic in her eyes and in her touch. He remembered,
suddenly and with hardship, how he had looked
from the hilly fields not long ago, and had seen her in
Gaunt&#8217;s arms. It was true that his temper was brittle
nowadays&mdash;the temper of David the Smith, which Garth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
folk spoke of reverently as they spoke of steadfast summer
weather&mdash;and he had been over-brave to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friendship be damned!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take more
or less, Priscilla, and good night to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was gone, and Priscilla of the Good Intent was left
in the starlit road. And first she laughed, because she
could not help it, hearing David break away from his
quiet, Puritan mother tongue. And then she sighed, and
wished him back again. And afterwards she glanced at
Charley&#8217;s Wain, overlooking the trim farmstead, and wondered
if she had a heart at all, or whether it had only gone
astray. Certain it was that she had never liked David as
she did to-night, had never seen the real man peep out so
clearly. Still wanting help from him&mdash;help against herself,
or against Gaunt, she knew not which&mdash;she had
called to him before she could check the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;David, come back!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>But David was striding down Garth Street, and was
blaming himself for the odd language he had used toward
Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet of tongue, am I?&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Why break
out when the lile lass comes to bid good night to me?
Nay, David, nay! Thou&#8217;rt a clumsy lad, when all&#8217;s said,
and deserved to lose her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quiet and still was Garth village, as David walked down
its moonlit length. The gentle noises of the day were
gone; no voice passed gossip up and down the road, no
footfall, save David&#8217;s, lifted the light April dust; the grey
fronts of the houses seemed full of ripe and mellow thought,
and from their gardens came a warm faint smell of flowers
and green-stuff.</p>

<p>Now that he was to leave it, the sense of home rushed
in on David with new-found force. He had felt the more
in times past, maybe, because he rarely found an outlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
for his affections in words or ordered thoughts; and to-night
he knew, keenly and with pain, how much he cared
for Cilla, how much he cared for this grey street and the
grey circling hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to leave ye, Garth,&#8221; he muttered huskily.
&#8220;Ay, that&#8217;s about the size of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he neared the grindstone&mdash;standing by the wall-side
like some old pensioner who knows his working past
secure and thrives upon the after ease&mdash;he saw a light
go shining out across the road from Widow Lister&#8217;s
cottage. He saw, too, a plump, small figure of a woman
standing at the door. Nanny Lister, it was said in Garth,
would never go to bed till the last chance of a gossip had
gone down the night, and she was holding to her reputation,
so it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, &#8217;tis ye, David!&#8221; she said, after peering out to
learn who this late comer might be. &#8220;Well, ye&#8217;re just in
time, for I&#8217;ve a grievance, and you&#8217;re the best-tempered
man i&#8217; Garth&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; laughed David, not sorry for this interruption
to his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well they say so, though I trust no man&#8217;s temper
myself. Men have a trick of crazying about some lile slip
of a lass or other, and I should know their tempers by
this time, having lived with a husband and buried
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lister lies snug, Widow,&#8221; said David, with a touch
of that lightness which Cilla had noticed in him throughout
the evening. &#8220;Turfed over, he, and resting from the
<i>clack-clack</i> of a tongue, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was odd that the widow, old and ripish in experience,
felt just as Cilla had done&mdash;that David showed comelier
when he got a bright edge to his tongue. She bridled a
little, to be sure; but that was only a return of youth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
an instinct to stand off from and thwart a man when
most she liked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unwedded folk should never talk to wedded ones,
David. Maids and bachelors, I always did say, are like
children playing wi&#8217; dandelion-fluff, blowing to ask if &#8217;tis
this day, or next day, sometime, never, that the right lad&#8217;s
going to come a-wooing. Well, he comes, and he isn&#8217;t
so bright, after all, when ye&#8217;ve lived with him a year or
two&mdash;but ye&#8217;re sort of fond of him and his foolishness&mdash;and
ye put up with him, and bake his bread for him, and
hearken to his whimsies when he comes home tired o&#8217;
nights and hugs the chimney-corner. That&#8217;s all a side
o&#8217; life ye&#8217;re deaf to, David, and I go pitying all ye stark,
unwedded folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>David would have winced at another time; but to-night
he had fought his battle, had decided once for all to give
up Cilla and the grey village which she queened, and he
was perilously gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give pity where &#8217;tis asked, Widow,&#8221; he answered
blithely. &#8220;I have the forge, for my part, and a quiet
cottage to go home to, and a power o&#8217; freedom ye wedded
folk seem always to be missing. Did ye ever hear of
the fox that got caught in a gin in Sharprise Wood and
lost his tail, and went prating afterwards that he looked
bonnier for the loss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re very full of heart to-night, David. Pranksome,
I should call ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have need to be. Just once a year the springtime
comes, Widow, and it behoves folk to be pranksome
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, listen to me, for I said you were sound
of temper, and I&#8217;m in one of my angry fits just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>David looked at her plump, wholesome cheeks, and
laughed. &#8220;Ye carry it well, I must say, Widow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Ay, women&mdash;&#8217;specially lone widows&mdash;were born
just to try and hold up their heads and pretend, like,
naught matters anyway. What I want ye to look at,
David&mdash;the moon, young as she is, is better than a candle
to see by&mdash;what I want ye to look at is my bit of a garden
here. &#8217;Tis no way big, David, and a plumpish cow could
lie along it, and ye&#8217;d never know there was a garden
there; but &#8217;tis all I&#8217;ve got, and it rears a good few blooms
from March time on to winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonniest slip o&#8217; garden in all Garth. Well, then,
Widow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t well at all. Stoop down, David, and see where
the auriculas were when I slipped, yesternight, to bed. See
where the tulips were, and where the daffy-down-dillies
were blowing all their trumpets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, they&#8217;re gone, for sure,&#8221; said David, with real
concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone? Should think they were. I came out this
morning&mdash;feeling as cheerful as a lone widow ever does&mdash;and
thought to water my bit of a garden. Found every
single bloom picked off, David, and laid along the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, I&#8217;m sorry! Pride ourselves, we in Garth,
that our gardens neighbour the road, and yet no hand
comes picking flowers by stealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twasn&#8217;t a hand. &#8217;Twas greedy bird-beaks, David.
Ye&#8217;re friends with John Hirst, up yonder at Good Intent?
Well, ye can tell him from Widow Lister that &#8217;tis time he
penned his turkeys up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve settled to do that to-morrow, as it chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should have done it a two-week ago,&#8221; went on the
other briskly. &#8220;Fussy, ill-conditioned fowls, I call &#8217;em.
Every morn they come gobble-di-gobble down street,
waking honest folk before &#8217;tis time to wake. Heard &#8217;em
this morn, louder than ever, right under my up-stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
window, but I didn&#8217;t guess they were picking off my flower-heads
for a bit o&#8217; frolic. Wish I had. Would have been
after them wi&#8217; the thick end of a besom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s done can&#8217;t be mended, Widow. There&#8217;s a
lot of comfort in that. Good night to ye; and, if you&#8217;re
civil-like to David the Smith to-morn, he&#8217;ll likely bring
a fresh lot o&#8217; flowering stuff to fashion up your garden
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow bade him good night in return, and let him
go some twenty yards along the street. Then, with the
trick that ran in her family, she followed him and called
him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not only John Hirst&#8217;s turkeys,&#8221; she panted, coming
close to David. &#8220;His daughter went roving, too,
to-day. Got up on the coach for Keta&#8217;s Well, and Reuben
Gaunt beside her. They didn&#8217;t return to Garth by coach,
I noticed, and if I had John Hirst&#8217;s ear&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;d talk a lot of nonsense into it,&#8221; broke in David,
sharply. &#8220;Miss Priscilla came home along the fields
with Mr. Gaunt, for I met them. And why shouldn&#8217;t
she, say I, if she&#8217;s a mind to?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not just truth that David spoke; but it was true
to the hilt in this&mdash;that the good name of Cilla was to be
kept sacred in Garth village at any hazard.</p>

<p>As he neared the forge, a shadow got out from the wall-side
and approached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to work, like?&#8221; said Fool Billy, stretching
himself with easy unconcern. &#8220;Knew you would, though
ye&#8217;re longer in coming than I looked for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knew I would?&#8221; echoed David. &#8220;How&#8217;s that,
lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay. Ye said ye were going to Good Intent, and Fool
Billy knew ye&#8217;d come home by soon, or sooner, and work
it off. Ye always do, David, after Good Intent. I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
ready for my playtime, too. Have slept awhile, I, since
watching the lile trim wren-bird sitting on her eggs as
snug as clover to the ground. Ready to play, David,
is this same Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into the forge, and got the fire alight and
glowing, and David worked till the sweat ran down him,
because only in the friendly feel of iron and tools could
he find ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; he said, looking up suddenly, &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving
Garth&mdash;leaving grey Garth, Billy, and going overseas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, I&#8217;m coming with ye,&#8221; said the other instantly.
&#8220;Me to play and ye to work&mdash;how would this
Fool Billy of a world do without us two?&#8221;</p>

<p>David took up his hammer again, and made the anvil
ring. &#8220;Stay and see to Miss Good Intent&mdash;stay and
watch over her, Billy,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Billy looked steadfastly at his comrade; and, though the
fire-glow shone on his face, showing each smooth, unwrinkled
curve, David could not understand what was
in the natural&#8217;s thoughts. It was a half-hour before Billy
explained himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best take her with us, David,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">REUBEN GAUNT, on the morrow of his holiday at
Keta&#8217;s Well, woke early. A thrush was piping
from the lilac-trees outside his window, and the clean
smell of the morning came through the casement. He
remembered the magic of that evening walk across the
fields, and found resolution come easily to him.</p>

<p>His resolution did not fail him when he had breakfasted
and ordered the black cob to be saddled. He would
ride across to Good Intent, find Cilla&#8217;s father, and tell
his errand.</p>

<p>Yet, while his horse was being saddled, another thought
came to him; he was pacing up and down the trim, smooth
lawn which, newly-mown, stretched to the low wall
bordering the highroad. The house behind him showed
big for a yeoman&#8217;s, prosperous and well built, and the
garden-spaces about the lawn were trimly kept. It looked
a good home for a bride to come to.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Hirst will be busy, likely, about the fields,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;before I get to Good Intent. Well, then, I&#8217;ll
ride round by the moor, and take my time about it, and
trust to finding him nearer the dinner-hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not sorry for the respite, as he mounted and
turned the cob&#8217;s head, not down the broad, white highway
to Garth, but up the winding track that led him to the
moor. This meeting with Cilla&#8217;s father had to be, but
he liked it none the better on that account, and he guessed
what sort of welcome he would get.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Gaunt seldom probed into other folks&#8217; motives, or his
own; and he did not know that there was more behind
this roundabout journey to Good Intent than was explained
either by mistrust of his welcome, or by liking
for a long ride up the open lands. His project was so
dimly formed that, even when he reached the moor, he
turned again to the left, and not along the right-hand
track that led him to Hirst&#8217;s farm.</p>

<p>He crossed the stream that, just below, ran brown and
sparkling into the walled pool used in time of sheep-washing.
The track now was only a narrow, lumpy lane,
winding between sloping moor above and sharply falling
moor beneath, such as was plied in October by the bracken-sledges.
Presently it narrowed again into a foot-trail of
the sheep; but Gaunt, keeping his eyes on the pitfalls
by the way, went forward and up towards the waving line
of grey-black which marked the topmost ridge of heath.
His cob moved daintily, not liking the rude menace of
the ground, until at last they gained the higher lands, went
quietly over a level stretch of peat, and halted at the edge
of Water Ghyll.</p>

<p>He looked down upon the steep descent&mdash;rocks, and
heather-clumps, and tufts of fern new-greening in among
the rusty last year&#8217;s fronds&mdash;then glanced across at
Clifford&#8217;s Peel, where its battered remnants stood four-square
still to the winds, and prated of old days when the
Scotch came raiding sheep and cattle from off the pastured
slopes of Garth. It was here that Cilla and he had
wandered as boy and girl, here that they had sought great
mysteries in among the beetling rocks, the rowans, the
deep, thick clumps of ling and cranberry. Water Ghyll
had been a forbidden, happy land to them in those days,
and they had always reached Garth again with tired feet
and glowing cheeks, feeling that they had come safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
through hazardous adventures, and trusting soon to tempt
again the frowns of peril.</p>

<p>Gaunt thought tenderly of Cilla, as he recalled those
far-off scampers. Wisdom in action came harder to him
always than tenderness of thought; and by that token
more women&#8217;s tears had been shed on his account than
he deserved.</p>

<p>He had won her at long last, he told himself; and this
wild trough of the moors, filled all with peat and rocks
and silver music of the stream below, seemed to hold some
special greeting for him.</p>

<p>As he looked about him, and across the Ghyll, and down
into the haunted streamway, his horse began to fidget,
then reared suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s amiss, old lad?&#8221; laughed Reuben, all but
unseated. &#8220;Was in a brown study, I, and thou&#8217;st spoilt
it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later a woman, climbing the steep face of the
Ghyll, showed her head above the ling. Gaunt had been
too lost in his own dreams to hear the rattle of loose stones
that witnessed to her climb, though his horse had not.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s face was beaten hard by toil and weather,
yet she carried it straight on her broad shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ye, Reuben Gaunt?&#8221; she said, without surprise.</p>

<p>Reuben, scarce recovered from the first shock of the
cob&#8217;s uprearing, was met by a sharper one. Yet again he
laughed, for the crisp of the morning&#8217;s vigour was in him,
as in all things that moved on two legs or on four.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you good day, Mrs. Mathewson! Scarce looked
to see you here in these lone parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same to ye! Least looked for, surest found, is Mr.
Gaunt of Marshlands.&#8221; Her eyes&mdash;hazel and big and
clear, the one youthful relic that Widow Mathewson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
possessed&mdash;rested quietly on Gaunt&#8217;s own until he
flinched. She was so sure of his frailty; so acquiescent,
in a bitter, stifled way, under the trouble he had caused
her aforetime, and now was causing her; so sure of
her own honesty, and of his lack of it. &#8220;As usual,
&#8217;twould seem, I am busy, and ye are idle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a day to be idle on, if ever there was one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe, for those born to addle no bite and sup.
For my part, I&#8217;ve been seeking strayed sheep all across
the moor, and not found them yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then ye&#8217;ve done no more work than I since sunrise,&#8221;
said Gaunt.</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson rested both hands on her hips, and
drew herself yet straighter. Standing there in the sunlight,
framed by the swart moor and the dappled sky,
she seemed to Gaunt like a carven likeness of her
daughter Peggy&mdash;of Peggy, grown older, harder, disillusioned
altogether. The straight glance that rested on
him was Peggy&#8217;s, too, and the mouth curved into a disdain
that despised itself; only the daughter&#8217;s comely youth
was lacking, and the flood of passion in her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looking for sheep would seem to be my trade in life
from cradle-time,&#8221; she said. Her voice was grimly playful,
lest the tragic note should sound too clearly and beat down
the reserve she cherished. &#8220;Ay, I&#8217;ve been all my life
looking for sheep and not finding &#8217;em, Reuben Gaunt. A
man&#8217;s love, and bairns, and profit from farming lean,
intaken land&mdash;I&#8217;ve sought &#8217;em all in my time, and found
&#8217;em go bo-peeping like the ewes I&#8217;m following now. Life&#8217;s
like that, till ye&#8217;ve done with it&mdash;and maybe then we&#8217;ll
find no softer bed to lie on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cheery, Mrs. Mathewson,&#8221; put in Reuben
drily. &#8220;Nice neighbour-body to fall in with, when a man&#8217;s
spirits are running high.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve done with cheeriness&mdash;done with overmuch
grief, too, by that token. Sometimes, when I look at ye,
Reuben Gaunt, a touch of the old fire comes to me, and
I long to throttle ye, stark where ye stand. Then I laugh
to myself, knowing I&#8217;d fail at the job, somehow, though
I brought all the will in the world to it. Peggy will have
to thole her misery, as I did mine at her age; and, by that
token, I&#8217;m keeping ye from riding out to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt knew at last the hidden motive for his journey.
He had not confessed it to himself; but this woman,
with the hard, clear eyes and clear, hard insight into life,
had found the truth for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m riding in the contrary direction, as it chances,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that proves the matter. There&#8217;s other birds like
ye, prettyish and small of build, that fly zig-zag to their
nests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt was nettled in earnest now. &#8220;As you want a plain
tale, you shall have it,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
marry John Hirst&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson knew no surprises nowadays; she
had outlived them. &#8220;Guessed as much yesternight,&#8221;
she said, speaking only half the truth for once, like Reuben
himself. Yet it was only the name of her daughter&#8217;s rival
that she had lacked. &#8220;Peggy went to bed with tears in
her een, and in the middle of the night she wakened me
with her sobbing in the next-door room. Queer that such
as ye can keep such as Peggy wetting blankets with her
tears; but I did the same in my time for as poor a dandy-tuft
of a man as ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are good friends, seemingly,&#8221; said Gaunt impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, close as bee and flower, Reuben Gaunt. Ride
down to Peggy&mdash;she&#8217;s throng with churning&mdash;and tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
her the same lies that I hearkened to when I was ripe and
young. God plants the like garden for all women, I take
it, with the like apples in it; and, whether the man be
half a man or a tenth part, &#8217;tis all one. Reuben Gaunt,&#8221;
she broke off, with the passion she had denied not long ago,
&#8220;why did ye keep your saddle just now when I frightened
that horse of yours? There&#8217;s a sharp rock on either hand
of ye, and two or three in front; whichever way your horse
had thrown ye, ye&#8217;d not have lighted soft&mdash;and it might
have been on your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned young to keep the saddle, though I&#8217;m loth
to disappoint you, Mrs. Mathewson,&#8221; said Gaunt, recovering
his air of unconcern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should have been glad, I, to see ye with your head
smashed in,&#8221; went on the other dispassionately; &#8220;glad,
too, to think &#8217;twas I that started your horse. But it was
not like to be; for ye always had the luck. Luck doesn&#8217;t
run in my family, and never did.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence between them, as they faced each
other, the only human-folk in this lonely stretch of heath.
In a place more busy, with others near at hand to temper
the reality of what he saw in the woman&#8217;s face, of what
he heard in her voice, Reuben Gaunt might have carried
the matter off with more success; but they were alone
with the rugged moor. He saw, during this time of silence,
his past life stretching behind him like a miry, ill-found
road. He knew himself dishonest, though he tried to find
again his old, easy outlook upon life. A naked man, facing
the naked truth, was Reuben Gaunt this once; and there
was no Cilla here, sitting beside him as they travelled down
the road to Garth and bringing to him thoughts of tranquil
betterment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be going up the moor,&#8221; he said at last, fumbling
with the reins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;Ay, I would. Then turn to the right, and down to the
right again&mdash;ye know your way to Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in the woman&#8217;s bitter jest that
struck deeper than any curse would have done. Gaunt
looked over his shoulder once, as he rode up the slope, and
saw her standing, at once the victim of destiny and its
symbol; and the breeze felt chilly to him on the sudden, as
if there were snow behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas she that put the notion into my head,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll ride to Ghyll, as she bids me,
and I&#8217;ll see Peggy for the last time. We should part
friends, and last night&#8217;s parting was no friendly
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to the marshy flats on the moor-top where the
stream had birth that ran through Water Ghyll. Wide
to the north and south, wide to the east and west, swept
the hills and moors and fields; here a broken ridge, and
there a soft-descending, rolling spur of hills, showed like
a rude girdle to the comely Vale of Garth. Beneath his
horse&#8217;s feet the grouse got up and whirred, crying, crying
over the desolate land; and the sky seemed near, as if a
man, by reaching up, could touch it almost.</p>

<p>In amongst the marshes Gaunt saw the sheep which
Widow Mathewson was seeking. They were feeding on
the rich butter-grass that grew in treacherous places, and
he knew them by the branded <i>M</i>, red-painted on their
fleeces. Good-naturedly he turned shepherd for awhile,
drew round them&mdash;the cob showing frankly his distaste
for the wet ground&mdash;and, by dint of whistling, as if he
had a farm-dog with him, and by skill of horsemanship,
he gathered the ewes into a flock before him. And so he
rode down the moor again, forgetting his mistrust of
Widow Mathewson in the sly pleasure of succouring her
at need.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>She was standing where he left her, looking up the moor.
Indeed, the big heath held only one figure and one thought
for her; strong and weak herself, she loved the weakness
and the strength of her daughter, the one link in her life
that no storm had been powerful enough to break. She
was past the stress of youth; but she remembered, and in
her heart she was praying&mdash;she, who never went to kirk
or chapel&mdash;that Reuben Gaunt might die.</p>

<p>Gaunt whistled low and clear again, and sent down
the sheep&mdash;a huddled, scampering flock&mdash;toward the
woman. He was no fool in matters of the farm, but at
usual times he was too indolent to use his gifts in that
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coals of fire!&#8221; he shouted, putting a hand to his mouth
to carry the sound up-wind. &#8220;Here are your sheep&mdash;gather
them in and drive &#8217;em home, Widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like him,&#8221; said Mrs. Mathewson, with patient wonder.
&#8220;Kills the heart in a woman one minute, and the
next goes out of his home-bee road to do her a good turn.
Would God I knew what sort o&#8217; clay this Reuben Gaunt
is made of!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gathered her flock together, and started to drive them
home; but Gaunt was riding straight across the moor,
and riding fast, for Ghyll.</p>

<p>It was easy, seeing the farm to-day, with the mellow
spring light dwarfed and sundered by its blackened walls&mdash;it
was easy to understand the gospel in which Widow
Mathewson and her daughter had been reared. It was
chary of spring, this farm; it had received more kicks
than halfpence from the weather; it looked askance at
gifts o&#8217; grace, and would not listen to the larks on this
blithe morning.</p>

<p>Peggy had just finished churning, when she heard the
sound of horse-hoofs. She stood and listened, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
was expectation in every line of her strong figure&mdash;and in
her face a wild self-pity and derision.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve come?&#8221; was her greeting, as Gaunt stepped
inside the dairy, after slipping the cob&#8217;s bridle about the
top bar of the outer gate. &#8220;Knew you would, soon
or late&mdash;but &#8217;tis full soon, Reuben, seeing that only last
night&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want us to part friends. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here,&#8221; broke
in the other, tapping his riding-breeches restlessly with his
crop.</p>

<p>The girl laughed. Gaunt had never heard disaster so
assured in any voice. It was as if the farmstead, and the
weather it had seen, and the tumults that had scarred its
walls, took human shape and utterance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how ye want us to part?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Will
ye be a fool to the end, Reuben Gaunt, or are ye thinking
life&#8217;s a game for bairns to sport with? Ride back through
the ling to lile Miss Good Intent, and tell her I&#8217;ve returned
ye with all the will in the world. Tell her that lasses catch
ye, like the plague, and lose what little looks they&#8217;ve got
through fretting for your tom-fool ways. Tell her&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke down suddenly, for the strain of the past
night, of the day&#8217;s labour at the churn, had told on
her. She had no tears left; but her eyes were full of a
soft mist, such as a warm gloaming draws from Garth
Valley in the spring. Peggy was beautiful to-day; her
tragedy was that of the ages, but her pathos was her own,
single and direct in its appeal.</p>

<p>The cool, whitewashed dairy framed her; the warm,
rich smell of milk and butter was about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy,&#8221; said Reuben Gaunt, &#8220;God knows &#8217;tis hard
to part from ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and God knows that Peggy Mathewson knows
your lies&mdash;knows them within and without&mdash;as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
knows her own face&mdash;her face, Reuben, that was bonnie
enough to catch ye, but not bonnie enough to hold ye
afterwards. See ye, lad, ye&#8217;re bent on killing me one way
or another. Why not take some handy stave and do it
now? Better soon than late, Reuben, if a body&#8217;s got to
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m marrying Priscilla of the Good Intent,&#8221; said Gaunt
doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know so much since yestere&#8217;en. D&#8217;ye think
to give her happiness, Reuben? I could never tell, myself,
what was in your mind, or out of it, at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come for a walk in the fields, Peggy,&#8221; he said, after
a restless silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can as well talk here, and thank ye. As I was saying,
ye puzzle me. A bit like thunder-weather, ye&mdash;the wind
blows one way and the clouds drive forrard t&#8217; other way.
Reuben, <i>do</i> ye think to make a happy wife of Miss Good
Intent?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was characteristic of this upland lass that she bore no
malice toward Cilla. Her quarrel was with Reuben here,
with her own weakness, with life itself; Priscilla was a
harmless and unmeaning bit of flesh to her, counting for
little either way, save that she chanced to be the one to
come between herself and Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make her happy&mdash;yes. May a man
never begin the good life, Peggy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; answered the other quietly. &#8220;A <i>man</i> may always&mdash;but
I cannot see ye doing it, Reuben, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had so much to tell you,&#8221; he said, after another
silence. &#8220;I wanted&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dare say, Reuben. Wanted to patch up the
road ye&#8217;ve fouled behind ye, afore taking to the smooth
road ready-made in front? Eh, but you must be a fool to
the marrow, after all! Dress all in your good clothes, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
it pleases ye, and put on a Sabbath face for other folk&mdash;but,
for mercy&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t come to Peggy Mathewson
after that fashion. Going to lead the good life, are ye?
Well, what of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no soft wind blowing here at Ghyll Farm,
as it had blown last night all down Garth Valley. For the
second time this morning Gaunt saw the simple, candid
picture of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were crying last night, Peggy. I looked for a
softer welcome,&#8221; he said, blurting out his thoughts as a
child might have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and was I? Who told ye that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fell in with Mrs. Mathewson as I rode up here.
Besides, I can see it in your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she found the sheep?&#8221; said Peggy, with desperate
pretence to ward off the graver issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found them for her. Say, Peggy, what were you crying
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy thought of the heart-break that had been her
mate last night &#8220;Crying for a lad ye&#8217;ll never know,
Reuben,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>He was quiet for awhile. Then suddenly his eyes caught
fire at hers. &#8220;Oh, come away to the fields,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We could aye talk better out o&#8217; doors, Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later Mrs. Mathewson returned, driving her
sheep, and found Gaunt&#8217;s horse tethered to the gateway.
The house was empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thole a lot,&#8221; she muttered, &#8220;but I&#8217;m no way going
to let Reuben Gaunt stable his horse in my paddock while
he goes knocking nails in Peggy&#8217;s coffin.&#8221;</p>

<p>She unfastened the cob&#8217;s bridle, opened the gate, and
sent him up in the moor. But first she took the bit from
his mouth, and laid it with the reins upon the ground;
for she had no wish to let the beast break his knees through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
getting the reins across his legs. The horse, glad of his
freedom, turned his head once or twice in search of Reuben,
then galloped off. And Widow Mathewson, who
seldom smiled, laughed grimly as she saw him breast the
moor-top, then disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt has galloped as free in his time,&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;Let him find his horse if he can, and catch it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PRISCILLA of the Good Intent had been restless
when she bade good night to David the Smith
and provoked from him a discourteous farewell. She
was more restless still when the birds awoke her soon after
dawn of the next day and would not let her get to sleep
again. So she got up, and lingered often at the open
window, listening to the bird-calls and all the fret of newly-wakened
life about the fields, while she washed, and
dressed herself, and went through the simple rites that
accompanied the beginning of the day in Garth.</p>

<p>She wondered if Reuben would like the blue print
gown better than the lilac one. Her head a little on one
side, a shy, quick splash of colour in her cheeks, she looked
from one dress to the other, and could not make her choice.
Cilla of the Good Intent was a changed lassie since that
glamoured walk across the fields with Reuben; wearing-gear
had troubled her little until yesterday, and she had
chosen her gowns by instinct, without conscious thought
about the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wearing the lilac one when he liked me first,&#8221;
she said, with a low, happy laugh. &#8220;Perhaps, when he
comes to-day, he will like to see me wearing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond the open window, where the fields sloped in
green hollows to the edge of Garth village, the birds could
not be quiet. Ousel-cocks were calling to their mates.
Throstles were whistling, piping, singing, the full flood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
of their melody let loose; and, like practised singers, they
could afford to play strange antics with their voices. Up
and down the scale the speckled songsters ran; and now
they whistled &#8220;come out&#8221;; and again they called, with
pretence of great sobriety, &#8220;There&#8217;s love a-waiting, love&#8217;s
a-waiting; love and his lile lass.&#8221; On the roof-tops starlings
cheeped, until they could bear the thrushes&#8217; rivalry
no longer, and began to mimic them in cracked and foolish
notes.</p>

<p>First love was harbouring with Priscilla. She was in
tune with the birds and the leafing land, and she had to
put a hand on the bosom of her lilac gown, because the
gladness of the day went almost beyond bearing.</p>

<p>For once, she was earlier abroad than her father, who
had allowed himself another hour of bed after yesterday&#8217;s
hardship in the fields. Before it was time to set his breakfast
on the board and pour out his tea for him, she had
done a score of little things about the house, and in the
dairy, and in the croft above the house where the fowls
were up betimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am going up the fields, father,&#8221; she said, as she cleared
the table after breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, lile lass! Maids must saunter time and time i&#8217;
spring. Wholesome, too, I say&mdash;and I warrant ye&#8217;ve
your day&#8217;s work trimly in your hands already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was down an hour before you, father,&#8221; she put in
playfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, old bones are lazy bones. Shame on me, Cilla,
lass, to break my fast at half after seven in the morning.
Ye&#8217;ll not tell David?&#8221; he added, with the boisterous
slyness that his daughter understood so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likely to,&#8221; she said demurely, and went up-stairs
to doff her apron and to don a hat.</p>

<p>Here, again, the earlier trouble beset her. What head-gear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
should she choose? To be sure, she did not look to
meet Reuben in the fields; but he might ride in for a talk
with her father&mdash;might be in the croft among the hens
and turkeys, or in the paddock, or in the house-place when
she returned. She wanted Reuben to approve her when
they met.</p>

<p>She made her choice at last, and Yeoman Hirst, just
going out to see that his men were at their work, turned
for a look at her as she came down the stair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, ye grow bonnier, Cilla!&#8221; he cried, with a
muffled roar of true affection. &#8220;Tuts! &#8217;Twill be a blithe
lad that tempts ye to share house with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla answered nothing, but nodded gravely at Yeoman
Hirst and went out by the door that opened on the garden.
Up the young, green pastures she went, carrying first
love with her. All things to-day were big with self-importance;
and she, who had thought but little of herself till
now, wondered if she would be always fair in Reuben&#8217;s
eyes. She trusted so; for Gaunt seemed worth the best
that she could bring him.</p>

<p>One deep regret she had, to temper the new gladness.
She was holding a secret from her father, and the knowledge,
just as it had done last night, brought a sense of
shame to her from time to time. In the background, too,
was another shadow&mdash;that of David the Smith, with his
abiding care for her. But the day was not one for shadow
except such as the sun and the breeze between them
chased across the pastures. The world would not let
Priscilla be out of mood with it; the reek of the drying
grass, on which late dewdrops lingered still, the clamour
of the birds, the restless pushing up toward the light of
winter&#8217;s hidden shoots&mdash;all was a conspiracy against
repinings or backward glances.</p>

<p>By the mossy lane past Brow-Top Ings she went, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
wild-strawberry blooms, white and starry, peeped out at
her from hidden nooks. Sometimes loitering, sometimes
moving quickly, as if her thoughts outpaced her, she found
the highest fields at last and saw the dark face of the moor
above her. Not caring where she went, and obeying any
whim, she climbed a fence or two and was free of the open
heath. Here, too, spring&#8217;s advance was plainly marked,
though it needs a subtler study to perceive it here than in
the lower lands.</p>

<p>Priscilla had no thought of foreign countries now.
Garth, whose face she knew&mdash;Garth, the familiar and
well-tried&mdash;was full of mysteries, delights, surprises.
Could she have ever thought, she wondered, that Reuben
Gaunt had painted fairer lands for her than this in which
she lived?</p>

<p>She lifted her head on the sudden, hearing a pad of
hoofs across the peaty ground. Gaunt&#8217;s horse, weary of
his freedom already and finding himself lost on the edge
of an alien moor, was searching for his master. Cilla
was the first human being he had seen since Widow Mathewson
loosed his bridle and sent him wide across the heath;
so now he came, with mincing steps across the broken
ground, and laid his muzzle in her hand, and asked for
guidance.</p>

<p>Cilla knew the horse; it was the best in Garth, indeed,
and known to folk less interested than she in Reuben.
Out from the blue sky and the sunshine fear came suddenly
to Priscilla of the Good Intent. Apart from love
of his master, there is always something of portent and
foreboding when a riderless horse comes fawning at one&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the master?&#8221; cried Priscilla, soothing his
muzzle with a hand that trembled.</p>

<p>The cob tossed his head. That was the question he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
had brought to Cilla, trusting that in her wisdom she would
give him a plain answer. She had none, it seemed, and
presently, growing restless again, he shook his head free
and cantered off.</p>

<p>Cilla watched him take wide circuits, slacken to a trot,
then to a walk. He was snuffing the ground like a hound
on trail, and last of all he seemed to find a clue, for he
turned down the moor along a narrow track, found the
gate open at the bottom and trotted out of sight. The girl
turned, and wandered as aimlessly about the moor as the
horse had done; she was sure that Reuben was lying
somewhere in the heather, thrown and badly hurt, and
unable to help himself.</p>

<p>What had she said to her father not long ago? That
snow might follow all this April weather. And now she
recalled the words, recalled the cold sense of foreboding
that had accompanied them.</p>

<p>Tired and out of breath she halted to look about her.
Again, like the horse, she sought for help&mdash;sought
dumbly for it&mdash;when her own instincts were at fault.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day to ye now. Te-he! Rare weather for the
time o&#8217; year,&#8221; came a voice at her elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Billy, Billy, you startled me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t do that&mdash;nay, not for a pipeful o&#8217; baccy,&#8221;
said Billy the Fool. &#8220;&#8217;Tis this way, as a body&#8217;s body
might strive to put that same into plainish speech. I&#8217;d been
peeping into a nest here, and a lile nest there, right up the
pastures; and Fool Billy got to the moor, he did, and
fancied he&#8217;d see if the peewits were a-laying on yond
ancient ground o&#8217; theirs up by Butter-grass Bogs. Then
I sees ye&mdash;and, durn th&#8217; odd button that&#8217;s left on my
coat, Miss Priscilla, if I thought twice again o&#8217; the
peewits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was always the courtier with Miss Good Intent;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
but she was too tired, too anxious, to give him more than
a wan smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me to find Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His horse
came to me just now, Billy, with no one in the saddle.
He&#8217;s lying somewhere on the moor, and I cannot find him.
You&#8217;re quick to find missing folk, they say, when they&#8217;re
four-footed&mdash;well, find Mr. Gaunt for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla did not know her own voice; it was so eager, so
impetuous. And she relied&mdash;and knew it, she who
had been self-dependent until now&mdash;upon Billy the
Fool.</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s face altered. Across the plump and childish
flesh stray wrinkles crept, as circles widen on a pool when
a stone is thrown into its waters. But Cilla, though she
looked at him with frank, steadfast gaze, could not guess
what was passing through his mind. So it would be with
Billy until the mould lay heavy on his coffin; a love greater
than Yeoman Hirst&#8217;s he had for Cilla, a love greater than
David the Smith&#8217;s; but his thoughts were prisoned up
in an unwieldy bulk of flesh, and to the end he would be
Billy the Fool, Billy the Well-Beloved, just as the moor
about Cilla and himself to-day would always be the moor,
telling her secrets to none.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Billy patiently, &#8220;I can find Mr.
Reuben Gaunt for ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he&mdash;is he hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sound as ye or me. Hurt? Not the sort o&#8217; man, he,
to get into hurt. Slips through and about matters that
might hurt him, like a snod trout when ye&#8217;re a-tickling of
his underward parts in Eller Beck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla did not heed the lad&#8217;s veiled dislike of Gaunt.
She was too glad to know that he was safe to care for
aught else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me where to find him,&#8221; she said impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take ye straight to where he is,&#8221; answered Billy
promptly, and set off down the slope.</p>

<p>He led her into the fields below, then to a little dingle,
all wooded in with thorns and slim, low hazel-shrubs.
Not a word would he speak, though Priscilla asked him
many questions by the way.</p>

<p>Gaunt might be safe; but to the girl there was something
uncanny in the natural&#8217;s silence. The wrinkles
were graven deeper now in his face, and Cilla, glancing
at him now and then, was awed by the look&mdash;fixed, inscrutable&mdash;in
the lad&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chanced on him through coming to see a blackbird&#8217;s
nest o&#8217; mine,&#8221; he said at last, when they were nearing the
dingle. &#8220;Had just pushed the twigs from together, and
peered in, to find the hen-bird off her nest&mdash;and I happened,
as Billy the Fool might say, to look beyond that
same old tree o&#8217; thorn, and down below I saw&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked the girl, fretting under all this needless
mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ll show ye, if so Mr. Reuben Gaunt be still
there or thereabouts. Now, step ye pratly, Miss Priscilla,
and keep your voice as low as any sparrow chirp; for the
mother-bird may well be sitting again, and &#8217;tis ill disturbing
mated folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether it were guile or instinct on Billy&#8217;s part, none
would ever know. He might have taken Cilla to twenty
equal vantage grounds from which to look into the hollow;
but he made for the thorn-bush, saw the bright eyes of the
bird watching him, took infinite pains to part the branches
a little to the right without disturbing her, then turned to
Cilla.</p>

<p>The girl, humouring what she fancied now must be
some delusion of the lad&#8217;s, crept under his outstretched
arm and looked down. A strip of broken turf, charred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
with primroses, sloped to the bubbling stream, and at the
water&#8217;s edge, Peggy was sitting with Gaunt&#8217;s arm about
her waist.</p>

<p>Priscilla gave no cry. The stream, the two figures sitting
by its rim, quivered and rocked, then circled round about
her. The primroses made thin, waving lines of yellow
across this evil, daytime vision. Then all was clear again&mdash;mercilessly
clear&mdash;and Gaunt&#8217;s head was near to
Peggy Mathewson&#8217;s, as last night it had been near to
Cilla&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent stepped back. She was
pale, but willowy and upright still; out of the generations
of the Hirsts that had fathered her, help came to her in
the hour of need.</p>

<p>She walked slowly back into the field, Billy following
close behind her. Whatever the natural had hoped to do
by this exploit, it was plain that, to his own thinking, he
had failed. He kept trying to find words, and, finding
none, reached out his hands toward Priscilla, with a
gesture piteous and helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I am troubled,&#8221; said Cilla, halting suddenly.
&#8220;No, you are not to come with me this once! I am
troubled&mdash;and, Billy, I must be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grave and sweet her voice was, sweet and grave her
consideration for the poor fool&#8217;s feelings when she had
need to think only of her own.</p>

<p>The natural watched her cross the pastures; then his
face twitched, and the lines came out on it afresh; and,
after that, he threw himself on the ground and dug his
fingers deep into the turf and cried like a three-year babe.
Afterwards he sat up, his face vacant as of old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems as if Billy the Fool were shut up tight in a
prison,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Wears what ye might call a
band of iron all round his head-piece, like, and he thinks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and he thinks, and naught comes on&#8217;t. Miss Good Intent&#8217;s
going to cry&mdash;and &#8217;tis Fool Billy made her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down yonder in the little dingle, Gaunt and Peggy
Mathewson were saying good-by. For an hour they
had sat by the stream, helpless in each other&#8217;s hands,
as they had always been. Gaunt had once more told her
frankly&mdash;he had found courage for that&mdash;that at all
hazards he meant to wed Priscilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I went and told her what ye&#8217;d said to me, and
what ye&#8217;d looked at me, and all the sorry tale?&#8221; cried
Peggy, roused from her desperate acquiescence in the
gospel that what would be, would be. &#8220;Would you fare
well, Reuben, with lile Miss Good Intent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well or ill, I should let you go with your tale. I&#8217;ll not
stand between Priscilla and the truth, if she must have it&mdash;but
I&#8217;ll not tell her it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There again, you&#8217;re a puzzle, just a puzzle,&#8221; she said,
with a quick return to her old manner. &#8220;Spoke like a
man just then, ye. Other times ye&#8217;ll be half a man, or
none at all. I&#8217;ve asked ye fifty times, Reuben, but could
find myself no nearer an answer yet&mdash;what was left out
of ye at birth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems power to guide myself was left out of me,&#8221;
he answered sharply. &#8220;Listen to me, Peggy! I&#8217;ve nothing
much behind me to boast of&mdash;but I love Hirst&#8217;s lile
lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, so ye said,&#8221; put in the other drily. &#8220;It scarce
helps me, Reuben, to hear it twice. For there&#8217;s my own
life, as it happens, as well as yours to reckon with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt felt like a man whose feet are caught by the bog.
The clean, dry land was near to him; but his feet were
chained, and it was hard to pluck them out.</p>

<p>As for Peggy, she was ready to drift into any mood,
and past days returned to her with sudden clearness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;Do ye mind the day we went to Linsall Fair? &#8217;Twas
years ago, Reuben, but I mind it still. You bought a ring
off a pedlar, and you set it on my finger. Lord, how it
all comes back!&#8221; she broke off, looking softly at him, so
that her likeness to her mother was altogether lost.
&#8220;There was a young moon over the fell-top, and folk were
dancing on the green; and you put the ring on my finger,
and my heart went all soft and shameless. Reuben, you
told me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Told you we were wedded; and we laughed. Ay, I
remember, Peggy!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they fell to quiet talk of bygone times. Peggy
wondered at her weakness, and Gaunt could not fathom
the meaning of his newly-wakened liking to be with this
lass when he should have been at Good Intent.</p>

<p>It was then that Billy the Fool guided Cilla to the thorn-bush
where the mother-blackbird sat upon her nest; but
neither Gaunt nor Peggy saw the stricken face that
watched them for a moment between the twigs, then
disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine-weather days don&#8217;t last, somehow,&#8221; went on the
girl. &#8220;We thought the world held no two folk, Reuben,
save ye and me? Well, we were fools for our pains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re good to look back on now and then, all the
same, those days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, where&#8217;s the use in your looking back? You feel
no warmer in winter-time by thinking of last summer&#8217;s
heat. <i>Good to look back on?</i> &#8217;Tis easy for ye to talk,
Reuben!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt got to his feet, and helped her up. &#8220;Time we
were moving, Peggy,&#8221; he said curtly&mdash;for he was fearing
the girl&#8217;s despair and tenderness. &#8220;Yond horse of mine
will be tearing the reins to bits, for I&#8217;ve kept him longer
tied to a gate-post than he ever was before.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;So &#8217;tis good-by?&#8221; she said, moving beside him up
the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, for it must be. Bygones are bygones, Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True&mdash;if ye let &#8217;em be. Never fear, Reuben! I&#8217;m as
proud as Miss Good Intent, or maybe more so, and I&#8217;ll
not trouble ye. Begin with your good life, lad, and see
if ye can carry it! And for all reward I&#8217;ll ask to see Miss
Priscilla&#8217;s face when a year&#8217;s gone by and the first bairn
has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben winced. None in Garth would have given him
credit for it; but, weak of purpose as he was, his love for
Cilla touched clean, wholesome thoughts that had been
stifled long ago. He resented Peggy&#8217;s easy speech touching
his marriage and what might, or might not, come afterwards.
The girl knew what was passing in his mind, and
laughed&mdash;not carelessly, but with the sadness that was
rooted deep in all her moods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to hurt ye, Reuben,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
delicate sort o&#8217; plant, and need a wall &#8217;twixt ye and the
wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent until Intake Farm was well in sight.
Peggy halted in the dip of the fields where the ragged
thorn-trees grew. She looked long and hard at Gaunt,
and again there was a strange beauty in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was going to ask ye for a last kiss, but I&#8217;m past that,
Reuben. Lad, I wonder will ye ever know the kisses we
might have had! I think ye&#8217;ll waken sometimes in the
night, and hunger for what&#8217;s past your getting any longer.
Fratch as we may, we were made each for the other, if
your een were open wide enough to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy, lass,&#8221; he began, moving nearer to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Reuben! Over and done with, like a last year&#8217;s
nest. Yond&#8217;s your way; I&#8217;m going wide into the moor,
to cool a touch of some daft fever that&#8217;s come over me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Irresolute, and glancing backward often, Reuben went
up toward Ghyll Farm. Life, that had seemed so plain
last night upon the Garth highroad, was tangled now. The
fierce, low passion of the girl&mdash;her certainty of heart-break,
with little complaining&mdash;a shrewd guess that she
was right in saying he would wake at night and think of her&mdash;these
were out of keeping with the primrose lanes of
yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis hard to go straight,&#8221; said Gaunt at last, with a
shrug of his shoulders, as he reached the paddock of Ghyll
Farm.</p>

<p>No horse was tethered to the gate; but over the top bar
leaned Widow Mathewson, her brown arms naked to the
sunlight and a look of grim derision on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeking a horse, Mr. Gaunt?&#8221; she asked, with studied
courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I tethered him to the gate here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;twill be the one I loosened an hour or so agone.
Found him here, when I came from driving sheep across
the moorland; and I hadn&#8217;t a use for him myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Reuben, falling in with the widow&#8217;s
own quiet tone. &#8220;Sensible thing, Mrs. Mathewson, to
loose a cob whenever ye find him tied to a gate-post by the
bridle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I thought myself&mdash;and, by that token, I slipped
the bridle from his mouth and laid it under the wall here.
Will ye take it with ye, Mr. Gaunt, or shall Peggy bring
it over to Marshlands? We&#8217;re simple, and ye&#8217;re reckoning
to be one o&#8217; the gentry-born nowadays; so I fancy ye&#8217;d
think it ill demeaned ye, like, to go carrying a horse&#8217;s
bridle in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt took the bridle, keeping his temper as best he
could. Quiet or stormy, Widow Mathewson always cut
like hail against his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll tell me where the cob went, the last
you saw of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up the moor, and seemed to relish his liberty. He
may be at Linsall by this time&mdash;though I doubt the
marshes on that side o&#8217; the heather would stop him&mdash;or
happen he&#8217;s taken t&#8217; other road, and got to Keta&#8217;s Well&mdash;or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where the devil am I to look for him?&#8221; snapped
Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows&mdash;which, as I&#8217;ve seen life, means always
that human-folk can&#8217;t guess. Where are Peggy&#8217;s wits,
Mr. Gaunt? God knows again&mdash;for bless me if her
mother does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben went off, the bridle dangling from his arm; and
Widow Mathewson turned across the paddock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon he&#8217;ll have a longish walk before him, any
way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Beggars don&#8217;t ride most times&mdash;and
neither does Reuben Gaunt to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt himself abandoned all thought of seeking the
cob. It would reach home, or he would hear of its whereabouts
to-morrow. Meanwhile, he was glad of this further
respite from his talk with Yeoman Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be too late, by the time I walked to Good
Intent,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ride up about supper-time,
and catch John Hirst in his ripe, evening humour.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he reached home, his cob was waiting for him
on his own lawn. It had jumped the round, grey wall
that guarded the highroad, and now, after a morning&#8217;s
tribulation, was seeking for grass-stalks on the shaven
lawn.</p>

<p>Horses and dogs were no harsh judges of Reuben Gaunt;
and now, as the cob came whinnying to him, he said to
himself with a laugh that it was the first friendly welcome
he had had since riding up to Ghyll.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Priscilla had gone across the fields, carrying first disillusionment
now in place of first love&mdash;the love that she
had buried yonder in the wooded dingle. She felt no
anger toward Reuben; it was as if she had seen him die
suddenly and without warning, had seen him pass into
a dim land of which she had no ken; and the stupor of
her grief for him was on her.</p>

<p>For herself, the silver thread was loosened that had bound
her to the spring. Sunlight and shadow on the pastures,
the rising skynote of the lark, the fretting of the curlews
and the plover; she saw and heard them, but could no
longer understand their beauty. Between herself and life
there was a dead, grey wall; and cowslips nodded vainly
to her as she passed, and, when the lambs came frisking
toward her, she did not heed them.</p>

<p>She was glad, on reaching Good Intent, to find that her
father had finished his early dinner and was out in the
fields. Mechanically she set about her duties, forgetting
to take food herself; and, like David, she found a certain
ease, a certain deadening of pain, in moving forward with
her work. When Hirst came in about half after four, she
was pale, and her eyes were listless, but she was mistress
of herself and ready with a greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou&#8217;st overtired thyself, lile lass,&#8221; said the farmer,
patting her shoulder as he crossed to the big hearth-chair.
&#8220;Eh, well! Maids will roam i&#8217; the spring, and forget
their victuals; and maybe, after all, it does them no great
harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gleam of comfort came to Cilla. She had no secret
now from this big-voiced, big-hearted father, who looked for
each passing change across her face as a lover might have
done. Sad she might be, but she could look at Yeoman
Hirst again and feel no shame.</p>

<p>&#8220;The spring tires one, father,&#8221; she answered quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;Should think it did!&#8221; cried the other, settling himself
with a pleasant uproar into his chair. &#8220;Blanketed in
snow one week, and blanketed the next in sunshine. Ne&#8217;er
heed, lassie; I&#8217;m no way for quarrelling myself with all
this warmth that&#8217;s bringing up the clover fair like a fairy&#8217;s
trick. Cilla, there&#8217;s David coming at five of the clock to
help wi&#8217; yond durned turkey-pen. I&#8217;m dry, lass, and I
won&#8217;t deny a measure of ale would hearten up my innards.
Let it be the light ale, though; light ale, light hearts, they
say in Garth&mdash;and, bless me, ye need a lightish heart
and a clearish head when it comes to netting off a
pen.&#8221;</p>

<p>David the Smith, punctual to five&mdash;by his favourite
clock, the sun&mdash;was waiting in the croft when Hirst came
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Evening, David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Evening, Farmer! And as likely a one as we&#8217;ll see
this side o&#8217; Michaelmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay&mdash;oh, ay. Wind a thought shrewder than it was
but nought to matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>David pointed to the upper corner of the croft.
&#8220;Thought ye told me all my stakes were lying where I
laid &#8217;em? Why, they&#8217;re tight in their places, Farmer, and
the skirting-boards all nailed trim and level.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other scratched his shaven chin and laughed.
&#8220;Between you and me, David,&#8221; he said, lowering his
voice to a confidential bellow, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t speak quite the
truth. Can drive a stake as true as any man, and can
nail the boards on trim enough; but, when it comes to
netting, my men and me are done, and &#8217;twas that we
wanted ye for to-day. It all comes o&#8217; listening to new-fangled
notions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, as for that, I know naught o&#8217; netting myself,&#8221;
said David, glancing at the plump, white rolls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
wire. &#8220;Always fenced the run with boarding, I. Who
brought the notion into Garth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben Gaunt, I fancy; though, if I&#8217;d known at first
that the notion came from that quarter, there&#8217;s never a
yard o&#8217; netting would have come into my lile croft. Well,
we&#8217;ve got the job on hand, David, and here my two men
are, and we&#8217;d best get agate with it, liking it or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farm-hands nodded cheerily to David. &#8220;Rum
goings on i&#8217; Garth,&#8221; said one. &#8220;Would as soon handle
a bunch o&#8217; thorn-prickles as yond lump o&#8217; wire. But
Farmer Hirst knows best&mdash;oh, ay, he&#8217;s for knowing
what is best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he doesn&#8217;t, ye&#8217;ve got to think so,&#8221; put in the
farmer drily. &#8220;Here, lads, buckle to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men handled the wire gingerly at first, then with
the carelessness begotten of a great despair. The uprights&mdash;seven
feet high&mdash;were standing like so many fingers,
pointing to the dappled sky; and, because the ground rose
sharply toward the further limit of the pen, the upper
poles looked down upon their neighbours in the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll begin on the level, like,&#8221; said Hirst, setting a
box of nails on the turf at his feet, and holding his hammer,
so David said, &#8220;as if he were going to fell a
bullock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beginning of the work was simple. The three
unrolled the wire and got one end of it into its place, while
Hirst nailed it fast against the upright. Then they
stretched it to the next upright, and so went forward
blithely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s naught so much to be feared, after all,&#8221; cried
John Hirst, his voice rousing a sentry-rook that was
watching them from the elm tree in the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naught, save sore hands,&#8221; assented David. &#8220;Though
I&#8217;ll own, Farmer, I never met stuff so maidish, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
crinkly-like to handle, as this same netting. Now, stretch
it, lads! There, &#8217;tis all in place for ye, Farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>They finished netting the low end of the pen, and turned
the corner; but soon the level of the ground grew higher,
and, though the poles about them were stationed true in
height, the netting would go lower and lower, till it threatened
to be merged altogether in the rising ground above.
They twisted it, and pulled it out of shape, and talked to
it as if it were a bairn to be coaxed into a good temper.
Naught served; the upper line of the wire descended
constantly, and the look of this late-builded turkey-pen
was a thing for the soberest man to laugh at.</p>

<p>John Hirst threw down his hammer at last, and kicked
the box of nails against the wall, and stood off from his
handiwork and looked at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not one to swear at any time,&#8221; he said, slowly,
&#8220;but <i>dang</i> yond netting. Dang Reuben Gaunt, moreover,
who brought new-fangled notions into Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four men retreated to the wall, and sat thereon,
glowering at the turkey-pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daren&#8217;t trust myself with speech, I,&#8221; said David.
&#8220;Should say terrible things o&#8217; yond wire-stuff, once I gave
leave to my tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell ye what,&#8221; said Hirst&mdash;his farm-men laughed
to see his temper go by the board for once&mdash;&#8220;I tell ye
what, David. We&#8217;ll rive the whole lot down, and build
up the pen with good, honest lathes like your father did,
and mine. And if any man speaks o&#8217; wire-netting in my
hearing for a year to come&mdash;why, I&#8217;ll ding him on the
lugs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Garth&#8217;s right, after all,&#8221; murmured one farm-man
to the other behind his hand. &#8220;Them turkeys will be
penned afore, or a lile while after, the next breeding-time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that ye&#8217;re saying?&#8221; roared Hirst, turning
on the whispering pair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, naught&mdash;just naught at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ye&#8217;d better not say it just now, all the same.
David, I fair hate to be beaten by a job! Let&#8217;s rive it down,
and bundle it into a corner, and have done wi&#8217; it. Garth
notions will be good enough for me in future, I warrant
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>David, too, was nettled, for it was seldom he went
wrong in anything concerned with handicraft. &#8220;Comes
o&#8217; bringing foreign truck into Garth Valley,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;Why ye and me should take to handling such outlandish
stuff at our time o&#8217; life, Farmer, is more than I can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gate of the croft was opened quietly, and Billy the
Fool sauntered idly towards them. The natural gave no
hint, in look or bearing, of the woful trouble he had caused
himself and Cilla up yonder on the brink of the wooded
hollow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, good day, misters all!&#8221; was his greeting, as he
slouched up, his hands thrust listlessly into the pockets
of his ancient trousers. &#8220;&#8217;Tis what Billy the Fool would
call a fine evening for the time o&#8217; year; and yet there&#8217;s
somewhat cold, and wet, and sharp, blowing up from
Easterby Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts!&#8221; said Yeoman Hirst. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re as wise as a fox
when it&#8217;s scenting a hen-house, Billy; but this weather
is nailed to the sky, I tell ye, and won&#8217;t shift for a brace
o&#8217; weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he,&#8221; answered Billy amicably. &#8220;I&#8217;m just telling
ye what I think myself&mdash;what I smell i&#8217; my nostrils, like&mdash;but
I was never one to guess what my betters were
thinking. Now, masters. I&#8217;ve been wondering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us, then,&#8221; said Hirst.</p>

<p>It was odd that he and David&mdash;the two most good-humoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
men in Garth&mdash;had lost their tempers utterly
to-night, and that it needed Billy&#8217;s advent to show them
the droll side of life again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering if there is a fill o&#8217; baccy among the
four o&#8217; ye&mdash;and maybe a match to kindle a light with.
Have been in terrible lonesome parts all day, and nigh
forgotten what a pipeful tastes like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun was getting down toward Sharprise Hill now,
and the smoke of Billy&#8217;s pipe rose so that the slanting sunbeams
caught it tranquilly, and the gnats, playing in this
warmth of spring new-found after the long winter, drifted
away in cloudy streams from a scent which they abhorred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye look terrible low in spirits, all of ye,&#8221; said Billy,
after he was sure that his pipe was drawing well. &#8220;I
fancied, when I came by just now, I&#8217;d never seen four men
sitting on a fence and looking so empty, like, of what they
lacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had not seemed to look at them until he neared the
fence; yet twenty yards away he had known what their
mood was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did ye ever handle wire-netting, Billy?&#8221; asked Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not that I can call to mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go up to yond turkey-pen, and see the way the
netting runs into the hillock, choose what a body does with
it; and, if ye can tell us wise folk how to set the durned
thing straight, there&#8217;s another fill o&#8217; baccy for you,
Billy, and a fill of ale, and another match to light your
pipe with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy strolled up to the pen&mdash;the rents in his breeches
showed the brown flesh through&mdash;and seemed not to
look at it at all. Then he came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misters, might a Fool Billy say somewhat to wise
folk?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say on, Billy, lad! Say on.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;Well, now, if Fool Billy were going to climb a hill,
like, after what ye might call a stretch o&#8217; level walking, he&#8217;d
sit him down first, would Billy, at th&#8217; hill-foot, and think
a deal about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, warrant he would!&#8221; chuckled David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;d start fair again for yond up-hill climb. Do
the like wi&#8217; your netting, misters? Cut &#8217;un off, says Billy,
where he begins to go up-hill&mdash;cut &#8217;un off as clean as a
whistle, and start him fair again.&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s practical mind grasped at once that this was
the right solution of the difficulty, and he laughed nearly
as loud as Yeoman Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems there&#8217;s only one wise man in Garth! To think
of us, Farmer, fuming and fretting, and wasting our time;
and Billy strolls up, and looks about him, and sets us
straight in a minute. How d&#8217;ye do it, Billy, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I do naught. I&#8217;d be feared to, David! A fearsome
thing &#8217;twould be if I&#8217;d to work like other-some of
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a great general Billy stood by, and watched the
progress of the work, when the four men set about their
task again. His advice proved sound, and the netting
began to climb the hill in an orderly, straight line.</p>

<p>As they worked&mdash;the sun lying now, a ball of softened
fire, upon the edge of Sharprise Hill&mdash;the gate of the
croft was opened again, impatiently this time, and Reuben
Gaunt came through on horseback. Billy had seen and
heard him long before the others had; but he was the
only one who did not turn his head about as Gaunt approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, Mr. Hirst,&#8221; said Reuben, not pleased to
find David and Billy here, yet striving to cover up his
uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; answered Hirst, his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
grown hard as a bit of limestone grit. &#8220;I&#8217;ll thank ye to
close that gate behind ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? There are no beasts in the croft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not here to argufy. When you find a gate shut,
shut it behind ye&mdash;that&#8217;s what I was taught as a
lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been a day of insults for Gaunt, and he longed to
snap some hasty answer out and ride away; but his errand
robbed him of this slight consolation, and he made the
best of an awkward matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, just run and shut that gate,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The natural turned at last, puffing gently at his pipe.
&#8220;Would oblige ye, I, but &#8217;tis one o&#8217; my playtime-days,
Mr. Reuben Gaunt. I&#8217;d have bad dreams to-night if I
did any work.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of Hirst&#8217;s men ran to shut the gate, and Reuben
looked the farmer in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a word with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it here, then, for I&#8217;m throng with work, and this
job has to be finished off to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be said here. &#8217;Tis a matter of private business,
Mr. Hirst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can spare ten minutes. David, see that these
idle rogues get forrard wi&#8217; their work,&#8221; he added, nodding
toward his farm-men as he moved off.</p>

<p>Gaunt dismounted and slipped the bridle through his
arm, and the two were half across the croft before Billy
found speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is yond turkey-cock o&#8217; yours abroad yet, Farmer, as a
body&#8217;s body might say?&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; answered Hirst, without turning his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, pen the devil up, says Fool Billy. Pen &#8217;un up,
Farmer!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had watched Hirst and Reuben Gaunt go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
slowly through the gate at the far end of the croft and up
into the pastures, the natural relapsed into his former attitude.
&#8220;Get forrard, ye three wise folk!&#8221; he said, with
inscrutable gravity of mien. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have th&#8217; old devil
wired and boarded in, come to-morrow&#8217;s morn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt found no easy task before him, now that he was
alone with Hirst in the upper field. The yeoman, hearty
and courteous to gentle and simple alike, could rarely
bring himself to be civil toward Reuben. As he put it
to himself, John Hirst had a &#8220;feeling as if a rat was crawling
over his chest when Gaunt of Marshlands was about.&#8221;
The younger man&#8217;s courage was chilled, moreover, by
the open insult Hirst had given him in face of the farm-men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the farmer, after a long silence.</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt took the fence, as he had taken many
another on hunting-days. &#8220;Cilla has said she&#8217;ll marry
me, and I rode down to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst gasped, then rubbed his eyes, as if he woke from
an evil dream and strove to shake it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that again,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla has promised to marry me, and I&#8217;m going to
be better than the Reuben Gaunt you&#8217;ve known.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was seldom that the yeoman could find a low voice
or a harsh one; but now he did, and his big, clean-cut
face had in it the look of a man when he meets an enemy
in righteous battle and lusts to kill him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar, Gaunt of Marshlands,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>Gaunt flushed. &#8220;Will you come down to the house,
then, and ask Cilla with me there, whether or no I&#8217;m a
liar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, by God I will! Seems you&#8217;re a fool, as well as a
liar, or you&#8217;d never put it to the test. What, my Cilla
mate wi&#8217; the likes o&#8217; ye? Ye&#8217;ve been drinking overmuch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
at race-meetings, or somewhat of that sort, to fancy such
outlandish nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the house with me, and ask Cilla,&#8221; said the
other, obstinately crushing down his spleen. &#8220;Is that
fair, or isn&#8217;t it, Mr. Hirst?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair? There&#8217;s naught fair when you come by with
your slippery ways. But I&#8217;ll take ye into my house, all the
same&mdash;for the last time&mdash;and I&#8217;ll set ye face to face with
my lass, and we&#8217;ll shame ye out of Garth, she and me
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind, that had been quietly veering all day to
north of west, blew shrewdly as they went across the croft,
at the far end of which Billy was overlooking the work of
his three comrades. Hirst did not heed the change of
wind; he was warm with faith of his little lass, and hot
with anger against Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ye in,&#8221; said Hirst, leading Reuben round to the
front door, whereas he would have ushered David in with
little ceremony through the outer kitchen. &#8220;Come ye in,
Mr. Gaunt, and I shall offer ye neither bite nor sup,
though that would seem a shameful thing for Good Intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am needing none,&#8221; said Reuben. &#8220;Seems a queer
thing, all the same, that when I come to you with a straight
tale&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A straight tale?&#8221; snapped Hirst &#8220;What about my
lass? Lad, ye&#8217;re crazy to think I don&#8217;t know your doings
five years agone all up and down the countryside. Step
in, however, and we&#8217;ll thrash this business out for good
and all.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">CILLA was leaning on the window-ledge when she
heard her father&#8217;s footstep in the porch. The
house-place was unlit and dim, save for the flickering
of a fire that was dying hard in the wide grate; but at
the window here there was a soft and tranquil light, half
from the gloaming and half from the clouded moon.
The geraniums, lined all along the ledge, showed a more
chastened red than in the sunlight. Outside, among the
lilacs and the hawthorns and the late-leafing copper
beeches, the birds were twittering restlessly, and now
and then were giving a last, clear challenge to the
night.</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent had been crying quietly.
She was stunned no longer, and had gone through a fire
of anguish in amongst her usual household business;
and now the tears had come, as dew falls on the parched,
tired fields. She was glad, when she heard her father&#8217;s
step, that it was dark indoors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Cilla, ye&#8217;re all in darkness here!&#8221; cried Hirst,
seeing her outlined by the half-light that filtered through
the window-space.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was idling, father. The day&#8217;s so sorry to go down
the hills, and I was sorry, too, to watch it go.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a brave stock came Cilla, and her voice was clear
and even.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but I&#8217;ve brought company, lile lass. I&#8217;ve promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
him neither bite nor sup, but at the least he must have
a candle lit here and there about the house-place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl raised her head quickly, and stood back a
step or two. It was hard enough to meet her father, but
she was not prepared to welcome &#8220;company&#8221; of any
sort. She tried, in the dusk of the room, to see who it
was that came, but the guest was hidden by Hirst&#8217;s bulk.</p>

<p>Not once did she guess that it could be Reuben Gaunt.
Had Billy the Fool not led her to the thorn-bush this
morning, such a visit would have been natural and looked-for;
but Cilla, single-hearted and understanding little
of concealment, could not realize that Gaunt, trusting in
her ignorance of all concerning Peggy Mathewson,
might still come asking Yeoman Hirst for his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you light the candles, father?&#8221; she said hurriedly.
&#8220;I&mdash;I am all in my workaday frock, and I must
tidy myself if you bring company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst would have had the matter settled at once; but,
before he could protest, the girl had run lightly up the
stair, and her footfall sounded crisply overhead. So he
lit the candles, standing in their handsome sticks of
Sheffield ware; and he took his place in front of the dying
fire, and stood very straight, thrusting his hands under
the lapels at his coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand where ye like, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will
not ask ye to sit, for some matters are best settled standing
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt moved restlessly about the room, and the silence&mdash;broken
by the little noise of Cilla&#8217;s movements overhead&mdash;did
not help him to a more even frame of mind.
But at least, he told himself, he had one ally here&mdash;Cilla
herself. When she came down, and Yeoman
Hirst heard from her own lips that she had plighted troth
last night, he could talk to better advantage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Cilla did not keep them waiting overlong. She had
no need to change her gown, but only to pour water into
the ewer, and bathe her face, and bathe it over and over
again; for she knew that her father hated all signs of
tears, because they weakened him and loosed his steady
grip on life.</p>

<p>They heard her at the stair-head, the two men waiting
below in enmity and silence; and then they heard the
door-sneck rattle, and Cilla stood for a moment, looking
across the candle-light to see who the guest might be.</p>

<p>She faltered for a moment, seeing Reuben&#8217;s eyes fixed
eagerly on hers; then she moved to the dresser and leaned
against it, one hand pressed tight against the bosom of
her dress, as her wont was always when she was troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You?</i>&#8221; she said faintly.</p>

<p>That was all; but Hirst, blind in his faith that Priscilla
could never stoop to such as Gaunt, interpreted
her trouble as sheer disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best come to what we&#8217;ve got to say at once, Cilla,&#8221;
he began. &#8220;Mr. Gaunt here said just now that you were
going to wed him, and I said he was a liar. Which of
us was right, lile lass?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Gaunt&#8217;s spirits fell. He had looked for silence&mdash;yes;
but for silence of the happy, maidish sort that is
afraid to tell its secrets. Priscilla of the Good Intent
wore no such look; grave, and delicate, and soft her
face was, but her eyes were full of misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right, both of you, father,&#8221; she said at last,
&#8220;and both wrong. I am not going to marry Mr. Gaunt,
but I promised to, yestre&#8217;en.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard to say which of the men was more non-plussed.
This slim maid, standing with the candle-light
upon her face, had robbed them both of sure yet separate
faiths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;Ye promised, Cilla?&#8221; said Hirst, reaching for the
snuff-box on the mantel, and taking a pinch for habit&#8217;s
sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I promised, father. But this morning I walked
up by Little Beck Hollow, and I took my promise back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt understood at last; and in his heart he cursed
Peggy Mathewson, who had led him into this.</p>

<p>The yeoman was hard hit, and hit in his weakest spot;
yet he gathered his strength up somehow, and found a
weakened echo of his usual laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second thoughts run safest, lass. Ye may have
been a lile, daft fool yestre&#8217;en, but ye are wise to-day.
Mr. Gaunt, is there aught more to be said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy not. Good even to you,&#8221; said Reuben, with
a desperate quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to see Mr. Gaunt to the door, father, and
talk with him,&#8221; said Cilla unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Hirst looked at her, and saw the strong simplicity
that hedged her sorrow round from prying eyes. He did
not know whether he were wise or foolish&mdash;all old landmarks
to-night were sundered from him&mdash;but he nodded
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye may, Cilla. &#8217;Tis the last time he will come here,&#8221;
he said, forgetting to touch wood when boasting openly.</p>

<p>Gaunt opened the door, and waited for her to pass
through into the grey moon-dusk of the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla,&#8221; he began, &#8220;Cilla, &#8217;twas kind of you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;twas kind of me&mdash;kind toward the lass I saw
you with to-day in Little Beck Hollow. Yestre&#8217;en was so
much fancy, was it not? Nay, you need not interrupt me.
The drive from Keta&#8217;s Well&mdash;the curlews dipping up and
down the fields&mdash;the smell of violets in the wind that blew
about Garth valley&mdash;they made us fairy-kist, I think, and
we fancied&mdash;what did we not fancy, Reuben?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Priscilla was self-possessed. The old reserve, half
pride, half modesty, had come to her again. She fenced
herself about, and Reuben Gaunt knew that the wall was
strong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I loved you, Cilla, and I told you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She strove to read his face, here by the light of the
clouded moon that shone upon the highway. Women
had done as much before Cilla&#8217;s time, in daylight and in
dusk, and had found no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loved me? I do not understand, Reuben. Love
is for one and for always, surely; &#8217;tis not a game to play
at hop-scotch with, as the children do about Garth street.
Reuben!&#8221; she went on, pain and sincerity between them
getting the better of her. &#8220;Reuben, I had heard stray
talk of you and Peggy Mathewson, and had passed it by,
because I do not care for gossip; but I saw to-day that
what I&#8217;d heard was true&mdash;and, Reuben&mdash;you needn&#8217;t
fear our last night&#8217;s fairy-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear it, Cilla? &#8217;Twas the love-time o&#8217; my life. See
ye, that other was a tale old and done with, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old and done with?&#8221; she echoed piteously. &#8220;If
the cobwebs had not been blown away, up yonder by the
Hollow, <i>I</i> should have been old and done with, to-morrow,
or the next day afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since grey old Garth was in the making, it had heard
such women&#8217;s cries; and to-night it listened sleepily, not
stirring from its quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye want of me, Cilla?&#8221; he asked, drawing
nearer with a caress which she avoided.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see you wedded. &#8217;Twas plain to be seen
this morning that you were promised to her, Reuben,
and last night&#8217;s forgotten altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Promised to her&mdash;what, to Peggy Mathewson?&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla would, or could not, realize all that was meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
by Gaunt&#8217;s hasty words&mdash;the surprise that he should be
thought to have meant at any time to marry Widow
Mathewson&#8217;s daughter&mdash;the touch of chill contempt in
his voice&mdash;the acknowledgment that all was &#8220;over and
done with,&#8221; and that his wooing up at Intake Farm had
been so much idle devilry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl answered simply. &#8220;What else, Reuben?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt knew that he had lost her. Her simplicity, the
return of that gentle aloofness which from the first had
thwarted and enticed him, the lack of all upbraiding&mdash;these,
and her trust in his good faith towards Peggy convinced
him. Random, full of odd weaknesses and hidden
corners where the better man in him took refuge, he was
surprised to-night to find how vital Cilla&#8217;s good opinion
was.</p>

<p>Before he could answer, footsteps sounded down the
road, and Priscilla turned quickly. &#8220;Good night, Reuben,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;All was glamour and fairy-webs yestre&#8217;en.
Forget it, soon or late.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was gone before he could find a last word to say.
He watched her go, slim, willowy, the clouded moonlight
on her trim, bared head; and then he turned, sick at
heart, and went round to the croft to find his horse, and
afterwards rode up the highway.</p>

<p>David the Smith and Billy passed him twenty yards
or so away from Good Intent. David greeted his enemy
coldly, but Billy seemed unaware that anybody shared
the highroad with himself and David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surly fools, the two of them!&#8221; muttered Gaunt.
&#8220;Could give any man a greeting, I, at this hour of a
warm night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent had reached the porch,
and stood there, half in the inner dusk and half in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
moonlight. She was thinking, not of Reuben Gaunt,
but of the night when she had seen David to the door,
had bidden farewell to him, and afterwards had called
&#8220;David&mdash;David, come back!&#8221; to unheeding ears. She
was reaching out again for David&#8217;s hand-grip, as she
always did in time of need.</p>

<p>David himself, as it chanced, had refrained from stepping
in at the back door of Good Intent, as his wont
had been. He had feared to meet Cilla, lest his resolution
to leave Garth should once again grow weak. Yet
now, as he glanced at the grey porch in passing, for old
affection&#8217;s sake, he saw Priscilla leaning against one of
the two round, limestone pillars that buttressed the
porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fair night for the time o&#8217; year, Priscilla,&#8221; he said,
with would-be cheeriness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, fair, David. But the wind blows shrewd at
times, for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts! We wouldn&#8217;t be living, if there weren&#8217;t a shrewd
wind to blow all our time o&#8217; warmth away,&#8221; growled
David, viewing life darkly, almost tragically, for once.
&#8220;We&#8217;d be dead, Priscilla, and in a bonnier world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy the Fool had gone forward, with a quiet nod
toward Cilla and an easy slouch, as if he remembered
nothing of the morning; but David halted. In sun or
rain, Priscilla was good to look at; to-night, with the
moon-glamour on her face and the fret of new-found
understanding in her voice, she was something up and
above this world, to such as simple David, like the moon
in the grey, still sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;David, is it true that you are leaving Garth, as father
hinted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, &#8217;tis true. Not yet awhile, for a week or two; for
my roots are here, ye see, Priscilla, and I&#8217;m frightened-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to tear &#8217;em out. So I&#8217;m telling myself I&#8217;ve a job
here and a job there that must be done; and I&#8217;m making
a few bits o&#8217; business that weren&#8217;t there before; but I&#8217;m
going from Garth, soon as I&#8217;ve settled my heart into its
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall miss you, David!&#8221; she said unthinkingly.</p>

<p>David the Smith laughed sadly. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s somewhat
to the good, at any rate. Would be a poor business,
eh, if a man could fare out to heathen parts, and
never be missed in the old home-place?&#8221;</p>

<p>The night, with its clouded moon, its restless wind
that rose uncertainly and fell again, was like a mirror
to Priscilla&#8217;s humour. She was impatient of David&#8217;s
quiet acceptance of matters; perhaps, had he stolen now
into the porch and lost his diffidence, he would have had
no further right, or leave, to go away from Garth. But
David had seen what he had seen, and his faith that Cilla
meant to marry Reuben Gaunt was as sure as hers had
been as regarded Peggy Mathewson.</p>

<p>And so, because guile was far from both of them,
David said good night and went his way, while Cilla
could scarcely check the impulse to cry once again:
&#8220;David&mdash;David, come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a last glance at the street, wondering what
her life would be in coming days; then went indoors, to
meet her father and go through with all the talk and explanation
which she knew awaited her.</p>

<p>The look of the house-place chilled her as she entered.
The fire was out. No friendly horn of ale rested at her
father&#8217;s elbow; he was not smoking even, but was sitting
with his hands upon his knees, his head a little bent, his
shoulders not so square as she was wont to see them.
The two candles threw no cheerful light, and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
guttering now in the sudden draught that came through
the open doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll light the lamp, father,&#8221; said Cilla, with faint-hearted
bustle. &#8220;Shame on me&mdash;the lamp unlit, and
none to draw your ale for you&mdash;and&mdash;daddy, won&#8217;t
you fill your pipe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was dreaming, lile Cilla&mdash;just dreaming, I. Fill
my pipe? To be sure, I&#8217;d quite forgotten it. Ay, light
the lamp, lile lass; I miss ye, somehow, when ye&#8217;re not
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>She brought his pipe, his tobacco-box; she lit the lamp,
and fetched a measure of ale and set it at his elbow; it
took the keen edge from her dreariness to minister to the
wants of Yeoman Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;See ye now, Cilla,&#8221; he began, puffing fiercely at his
pipe, &#8220;I want to know a few odd whys and wherefores.
Ye know my view of Reuben Gaunt? Is&#8217;t sober truth
that ye were foolish with him yesternight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father.&#8221; She was sitting opposite him across
the hearth, and her troubled eyes met his without fear
or secrecy. &#8220;I thought we loved each other, and I
promised myself to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God, ye rate yourself cheaper than I do, Cilla! There,
lile lass, there! I didn&#8217;t mean to be harsh! Well, then,
what chanced to alter you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I walked up the fields this morning,&#8221; she said, with
hesitation now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I know! What did ye find there? Not one to
shift round like a windle-straw, ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I found is not for you to ask, or me to tell,
father,&#8221; she answered, meeting his glance again. &#8220;I can
tell you this much&mdash;that the gloaming and the moon between
them were overstrong for me last night, and the
morning&#8217;s sunlight cured me of my fairy-madness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;Cured altogether, lile Cilla?&#8221; asked the farmer, after
a silence and a shrewd, long look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cured altogether&mdash;yes,&#8221; she answered gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good hearing. To tell the truth&mdash;and I&#8217;m no
way hurting ye by saying it now&mdash;if Garth Valley were
islanded by water, and ye and me and Gaunt were stranded
on it&mdash;as folk <i>are</i> stranded time and time in those outlandish,
heathen parts that David is going to, or says he
is&mdash;why, me and ye, lile lass, would keep to one quarter
o&#8217; the dry land, and I&#8217;d ram my fist into Gaunt&#8217;s face if
he came spying over to our end o&#8217; the safe, high country.
Couldn&#8217;t bide him, I, if there weren&#8217;t another man to talk
to in the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla scarcely heard him. Her glamour-tide was
over, or seemed to be; David was unrepentant of his
forthrightness, and would not see how she was hungering
for the word, or the look, or the touch which only he
could give.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here to my knee, lass,&#8221; said Hirst by and by.</p>

<p>She knelt on the patch-work rug, and put her hands
on his knee and rested her head on them, looking into the
fireless grate. So she had knelt in childhood&#8217;s days&mdash;and
afterwards at rare intervals when she and Yeoman
Hirst were moved to special tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t deny my pride&#8217;s had a fall, and a steepish
one,&#8221; he went on, thinking that his touch upon her hair
was gentle.</p>

<p>&#8220;So has mine, father; but life must go on, pride in one&#8217;s
way or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Art going to be a lile wise-woman before thy time?
Ay, pride tumbles and gets muckied, and ye&#8217;ve to clean
it up again wi&#8217; patience, as ye clean harness gear. Still,
I&#8217;m sticking to my pride, Cilla, till they coffin me up,
and so are ye; the Hirsts all do, by nature.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>They said nothing for awhile, but between them was
the speech of trust and understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla, lass?&#8221; said the yeoman presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I knew more about this daft business. Wish
ye could tell me, like, just what ye saw up yond green pasture-lands
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish so, too,&#8221; she answered simply; &#8220;but I cannot
tell you, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Hirst took a pull at his ale&mdash;the first one. &#8220;D&#8217;ye
know what I&#8217;ve been thinking, Cilla?&#8221; he said, wiping
the froth away from his lips with a kerchief patterned
all in blue and white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I could not guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, if it came to a tussle &#8217;twixt ye and me, I&#8217;d fare
hard. Ye&#8217;re so slim to look at, and I could lift ye wi&#8217;
one hand and think naught on&#8217;t&mdash;but your will is made
out of a piece o&#8217; hickory wood, I do believe. Like ye
the better for &#8217;t, I&mdash;though ye mustn&#8217;t let yourself hear
me say as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s likely to be no quarrel, father&mdash;now,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>John Hirst sat brooding by the fire, long after Cilla had
gone up to bed.</p>

<p>He stepped out-of-doors, before locking up for the
night, and looked at the shrouded moon, and tasted the
cold of the whimpering breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla said somewhat of snow coming, a day
or two gone by,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;and Billy the Fool
turned weather prophet, too, to-night. They&#8217;re apt
to be right Billy and lile Cilla, and there&#8217;s a snarl
and a tremor i&#8217; the wind that I should know by
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not confess so much to himself, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
superstition of those cradled by the weather was with
him, and in the wind&#8217;s contrariness and spite he heard
quiet omens of disaster to himself and those he
loved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PRISCILLA was not apt to lie awake nights for long.
The keen air of the fells, the round of her daily
work about the farm, forbade it. Yet, after she had
talked with David Blake in the moon-dusk of Garth
Street, had talked with her father afterwards beside the
hearth, she could not sleep, for shame of the kiss that
she had given to Reuben Gaunt, as they walked through
fairy-land last night&mdash;bitter shame of the scene that Billy
the Fool had shown her between the parted twigs of a bush
wherein a nesting blackbird sat. She felt a great loneliness,
an impulsive longing for the hand of David; she
seemed to stand in a wood where all the trees were thick
and heavy, and all the wonted tracks were lost.</p>

<p>When at last she fell to sleep, dreams chased her.
First David was laughing at her as he said farewell,
and got aboard a ship with big, white sails. Then Reuben
Gaunt was sinking in a moorland bog, and lifted
his two hands in appeal to her, and she was crossing some
stubborn waste of ling to reach him. Cilla of the Good Intent
was little used to nightmares, and she was glad when
at last the dawn stepped boldly into her room and roused
her. Her first thought was of the farm, her second of
the silence that lay about the house. The light which
came through the casement seemed brighter, colder than
a usual April dawn. There was no early challenge of
the throstle, no sleepy call of a linnet, and such sounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of human life as came from the roadway were strangely
muffled.</p>

<p>With a sense of trouble and foreboding Priscilla went
to the window, which she had left open to the soft night
wind not many hours ago. The low sill was an inch
deep in snow. She looked out, and in the white, strong
dawn-light saw nothing but whitened branches, whitened
mistal-roofs, and flakes that fell persistently. She stood
there awhile, watching the storm increase, listening to the
wind which, quiet till now, began to whisper round the
gables overhead. It was no playful shower, such as
often came in late April, waiting only for the midday
sun to banish it; yet, knowing the signs of weather as she
did, hearing that note in the rising wind whose meaning
was plain enough to all country folk, Priscilla felt no surprise.
It was fitting. Spring, with its make-believe of
primrose banks, and birds that litanied the sunshine, was
a dream she had dreamed in company with Reuben
Gaunt. That had passed, and hard winter had set in
again. She was glad that it was so. Winter was a time
of stress and hardship, that left no leisure for dreams.
Better the snow than the soft air of an April gloaming,
when all the tribes of furred and feathered things went
wooing and set the like key-note for more sober human-folk.</p>

<p>Priscilla turned to the ewer, with quick change of
mood. She blamed herself for those few moments at
the window. There would be real work ready to her
hand below stairs before this storm was ended. The
chill of the water heartened her, and afterwards she did
not halt to choose between the blue gown and the lilac.
She donned instead a rough, short-skirted gown of homespun,
and went down to the house-place. Her father
was standing in front of the fire, which Susan, the farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
maid, had newly lit, and the yeoman&#8217;s face was
grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought thou wert never coming, lass,&#8221; he growled,
trying to find his usual good temper. &#8220;You know
there&#8217;s a lamb-storm blowing up behind all this bonnie
snow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father&mdash;yes, I know, I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but is breakfast? Susan is young, and late&mdash;and
you are young and late, lile Cilla&mdash;you&#8217;d do without
your breakfasts, both of you, but old folk don&#8217;t start the
day on an empty stomach, lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susan came in at the moment with a dish of steaming
bacon, set round about with eggs, and the farmer sat
down to it with the impatience of a man who is thinking
only of his work and of the need to find sustenance for
the day&#8217;s battle. Cilla poured out the tea for him, brought
it to his elbow, ruffled her hand across his thick, grey
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lambs are needing you, father. Let me come
up with you into the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? You&#8217;ve work enough, lile lass, when we bring
the lamblings down into the fold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not till then, father. Let me go with you. I
shall be restless, else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst had all but finished half the dish of bacon, and
three eggs to go with it. He felt ready for the day&#8217;s
work, and, as the way of a true man is, his temper gained
in cheeriness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like a lover to your whims, lile Cilla. If you&#8217;re
set on coming&mdash;well, I&#8217;ve a sort o&#8217; fondness for the tread
o&#8217; your heels beside me. Hark ye! The wind&#8217;s rising
fast, and there&#8217;s a snarl at the tail on&#8217;t. &#8217;Tis a bitterish
end to spring warmth, this. Don your high boots,
lass, and don &#8217;em quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Cilla went, with the pleasant, quiet obedience which
smoothed many a rough road for Yeoman Hirst. She was
back again before he had time to grow impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, though I say it, Cilla, ye look workmanlike and
trim,&#8221; roared her father. And he laughed, as good
fathers will, with some surprise that he should have
reared a bairn so full of comeliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, there&#8217;s work up yonder in the snow,&#8221; she
answered, with a gentle laugh. &#8220;You can praise me
afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Hirst soberly. &#8220;Praise can always
bide like money in a safe-sure bank. Work willun&#8217;t bide;
it never did and it never will, lile Cilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road in front of Good Intent was thick with
snow when they went out, for the wind was harrying
it as farm dogs chase the roving sheep. Hirst&#8217;s own
dogs, when he whistled them from their shelter under
the windward side of a mistal, came trudging to him
through a lake of velvety, soft stuff that hindered
them.</p>

<p>They went up into the pastures, father and daughter,
and it was hard to tell where the ewes lay with their
lambs, or where the white hummocks of the snow were
lifted by the wind. Hirst&#8217;s farm-hands, cursing the
weather as they followed him, were puzzled to know snow
from fleece, and the dogs were full of petulance. The
snow came down in wet, big flakes. The wind sobbed
and wailed, and rose now and then in sudden gusts,
driving the snow-dust savagely across their eyes. And
through the wind-gusts, and the sharp, impatient barking
of the dogs, there came the wild crying of the sheep,
the pitiful and weakling cry of lambs half frozen.</p>

<p>One by one they found the ewes, and it was odd to see
how the mothers, not valiant at usual times, daft-wits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
bleating to the empty sky for wits denied them&mdash;grew
brave and full of strange resource.</p>

<p>If a farm-lad gathered a couple of lambs into his arms&mdash;twins,
which Farmer Hirst had boasted of last night&mdash;the
mother would grow manlike for the moment,
would seek for a point of vantage and charge him down.
When Priscilla&mdash;loved by all four-footed folk, and by
most of the two-footed kind&mdash;when Priscilla gathered a
lamb into her arms, to carry it down to the fold, it was
the same. There was panic among these bleak-witted
ewes; and, like all dreads, it brought out some hidden
source of courage.</p>

<p>David the Smith, scenting trouble, came trudging
through the snow to help his neighbour. He passed
Cilla with a quiet greeting&mdash;thinking overmuch of last
night&#8217;s farewell to her in Garth Street&mdash;and busied
himself at once with rescue of the flock. Simple of
mind, strong of body, he set to his task at once, shouldered
a ewe that was sick with the cold, and carried her down
the pastures and along Garth Street, until he came to the
turn of the road that led up to Good Intent. Widow
Lister was at her door, as usual, walking up and down
in front of her garden-strip, her feet protected from the
snow by huge pattens, her eyes opened wide for any
chance of gossip. She set her arms akimbo on seeing
David, and her tongue was stilled for a moment. Indeed,
David, swinging steadily forward under the burden that
hung limp across his shoulders, his face full of great
purpose and the tranquillity of strength, seemed to fill
the snow-set canvas of Garth village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, David,&#8221; said the widow, in an awed voice,
&#8220;you&#8217;re marrow to yond print o&#8217; the Good Shepherd
that&#8217;s hanging ower my chimbley-piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>David halted. The roots of his religion lay deep, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
maybe for that reason he seldom spoke of it. &#8220;Oh,
whisht, woman!&#8221; he said, with a shy, odd air of rebuke.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a plain man o&#8217; my hands, with a day&#8217;s
work to do. I&#8217;ll thank ye not to name me in company
with my betters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now!&#8221; put in the widow plaintively. &#8220;You&#8217;re
the first man I&#8217;ve come across who fought shy o&#8217; praise.
You <i>are</i> like, David, all the same&mdash;the ninety-and-nine
you&#8217;ve left to bring the lost odd &#8217;un in, just the same as
in the pictur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; answered David, as he moved forward, &#8220;but
some o&#8217; the ninety-and-nine are needing me, too, soon as
I&#8217;ve gotten this lile ewe into shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow let him make ten paces forward; then,
heedless as a child that every halt was so much added
to the dead weight on his shoulders, she tripped after
him, her pattens moving nimbly through the snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, David! I knew there was summat on my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>David turned with weary good nature. &#8220;Well, if
&#8217;tis as heavy as what I carry on my back, Widow, I&#8217;m
sorry for ye. What is &#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, &#8217;tis nobbut a bit of a window-fastener that willun&#8217;t
catch. &#8217;Tis such a little job, like, I thought you could slip
in, any odd moment you had to spare and mend it for
a poor, lone body. When the wind rises o&#8217; nights, David,
it wakes me fro&#8217; my sleep, rattling the window so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and your loneliness!&#8221; grumbled David. &#8220;Well,
I may think of it by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and, David&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the smith went forward, and laid the ewe in warm
quarters, and struck up again into the snow by a track
that avoided Widow Lister. Priscilla, meanwhile, had
gone far up the brink-fields, in search of any roving sheep
that might have been overblown before they could reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the lower pastures. It was Cilla&#8217;s way to seek always
after the folk who had strayed.</p>

<p>She found no sheep; but, at the top of the highest
brink-field she halted for a moment to look out and up
to the face of the bleak high moors. The snow came sparingly
now, the wind was falling, and far behind Sharprise
Hill a yellow light crept softly through the snow-clouds.</p>

<p>At the wall-corner where Priscilla stood, three long
pasture-fields met at the common drinking-trough&mdash;a
round, deep pool, fed by a spring which bubbled up from
the limestone at the bottom. One field of the three was
owned by Gaunt, and he, too, was seeking strayed ewes
this morning. They met face to face, he on one side of
the pool, Cilla on the other, and they were silent for
awhile, embarrassed by their memories of yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fit ending, eh, to sunshine and spring weather?&#8221;
said Gaunt at last, with bitterness and something near
to self-contempt.</p>

<p>Cilla&#8217;s pride had come to her aid. The wild-rose
colour was in her cheeks, but her head was held high, and
there was delicate scorn in the frank glance with which
she answered Reuben&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not used to weather, as we stay-at-homes are.
It is all in the year&#8217;s work, Mr. Gaunt. To-morrow, or
the next day after, we shall have forgotten there was snow
at all&mdash;unless we lose any of the lambs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt was not slow-witted, and he understood that
Cilla had taken firmer ground than he, and meant to
stand on it hereafter. There was to be no hint between
them, such as he had implied just now, that they had
shared a day whose magic both regretted. He began
to wonder if her heart had been in the matter at all, and
a wayward impulse came to him to piece their broken
love-tale together all afresh. Billy the Fool came up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
field behind them. David, as he carried a couple of lambs
to Good Intent, had met him in the roadway, and had suggested
that there was rare play-work to be done in helping
Farmer Hirst with the sheep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never found such a game, I,&#8221; David had said, with
his laugh that shook the hills, &#8220;as setting a daft ewe over
your shoulders, or carrying a couple o&#8217; lambkins i&#8217; your
arms. The sport might have been made for ye, lad
Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Billy had sought the pastures; and he chuckled
soberly, as he scrunched through the snow, to think &#8220;what
a terrible, queer notion David had for lighting on a bit
of frolic.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was only when he topped the last rise of the field,
and saw Gaunt talking to Priscilla across the pool, that
his face changed. At times the clouds and the content that
sheltered Billy from the realities of life were riven asunder,
and it was always the one picture that he saw&mdash;a way-worn
woman coming with her child to the gate of Marshlands,
the harsh refusal at the door. Now, as he went up
through the snow, he could recall the bitter cold of that
long ago night when his mother and he had sought shelter
in the porchway of a barn. Gaunt&#8217;s voice, which was
his father&#8217;s over again, so Garth folk said, had recalled
the past to Billy when earlier in the year he dropped
Reuben into a bed of growing nettles. The sight of him
now, his closeness to Priscilla, roused, not Billy&#8217;s strength,
but his will to use it blindly. Before Cilla knew that he
was near, he had passed her, had climbed the wall, had
put his arms about Gaunt and carried him to the edge
of the pool. Hirst himself, or big David, could not have
resisted the village fool when his quietness turned to fury;
and Gaunt was slight of build.</p>

<p>Priscilla was bewildered by the suddenness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
attack; but her habit was to meet emergencies&mdash;such as
Reuben&#8217;s disloyalty and the change in April&#8217;s weather&mdash;with
the reliance that came from clean living under the
clean, steady hills. She saw that Billy was swinging
his burden lightly over the pool; and in Billy&#8217;s face she
saw a tumult.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;Billy, what are you
doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned as a dog does when his master whistles, and
the evil left him&mdash;left him Fool Billy once again, with
surprise in his helpless face that he should ever have done
amiss. He set Gaunt gently down upon his feet, and
Reuben, sick at heart, went through the snow, and round
the bend of Little Beck Wood, and out of sight.</p>

<p>Billy climbed the wall, and stood a little behind Cilla,
waiting for chastisement.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you do it?&#8221; asked Cilla of the Good
Intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I could no way rightly tell ye.&#8221; His blue
eyes were fixed on hers, with the look which few who
cared for dogs or horses could resist. &#8220;Seems a sort o&#8217;
blindness comes on a body when he sees Reuben Gaunt,
and I put my head down like a bull and made for him.
Terrible weak in the head Billy is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was all&mdash;all so unlike you, Billy. What did
you mean to do with&mdash;with the man you held in your
arms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; he answered, with quiet surprise. &#8220;Why,
drown him, Miss Cilla, as ye do wi&#8217; kittens when they&#8217;re
not wanted, like. Am fond o&#8217; kittens, I, but they do get
terrible cumbersome at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, lad, go down to David at the forge,&#8221; said Cilla,
with a sudden laugh that was made up of pity and of
helplessness. &#8220;Go down to David, and tell him I sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
you to him for guidance. And, Billy, promise me that&mdash;lad
Billy, for my sake, promise you&#8217;ll not play with
life and death again.&#8221;</p>

<p>His muddled wits caught the one right appeal. &#8220;For
your sake, eh?&#8221; he asked. There was surrender and
question in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my sake&mdash;yes, of course. Always for my sake,
Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he!&#8221; chuckled Billy. &#8220;Will keep that notion
right in the middle of my daft head-piece, so I will.
Give ye good day, Miss Cilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and went down the slope with great cheeriness,
taking a bee-line through the snow and breasting
the drifts with the strong, unhurried ease that marked his
days. Cilla did not know it, but her plea that he should
do all things for her sake had made for Billy&#8217;s happiness.
To please her was frolic of the sort he enjoyed at David&#8217;s
forge, but a rarer and more pleasant frolic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathewson rented the third of the pastures that
clustered round the drinking-pool, and she was leaning
over her wall, a still, passionless figure. She had been a
looker-on at the struggle between Gaunt and the fool;
she was always a looker-on these days, grave, hard of
face, a little disdainful of the tumults that beset younger
folk. If swayed either way by feeling, she was pleased
that Gaunt should be belittled in Priscilla&#8217;s eyes; in no
case could it do him harm to meet with a tumble or
two in his erratic course. And yet, in some odd way
of her own, she &#8220;had a silly weakness, like&#8221; for this
will-o&#8217;-the-wisp who had caused her heartache in the
past, and would cause her heartache, doubtless, many
times again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost no lambs, Miss Priscilla,&#8221; said the widow,
enjoying Cilla&#8217;s startled backward glance. &#8220;Hope ye&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
had the same good luck yourselves down at Good Intent.
Oh, to be sure, there&#8217;s weather, and weather again, and
naught but weather, up here on the heights. We&#8217;ve got
to put up wi&#8217; &#8217;t, like ye put up wi&#8217; a silly, daft bairn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You startled me,&#8221; said Cilla, meeting Mrs. Mathewson&#8217;s
quiet glance. &#8220;Yes&mdash;oh, yes, our lambs are all
ingathered, or nearly all. I came up here to seek the last
two that are missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And found Reuben Gaunt, instead, and a big lad
holding him over the pool? Well, they&#8217;re neither on &#8217;em
lambs, an&#8217; neither on &#8217;em lions; but are just what ye
might call a mixture &#8217;twixt the two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harsh this woman might be, but to Cilla she stood just
now as something strong and honest, something that had
suffered, and stood firm, and been beaten by the weather
out of all comely shape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I care so little for gossip,&#8221; she began, moved by a
sudden impulse to confide in this woman who was grey
and hard as the wall on which she leaned. &#8220;Yet it
seems to meet you at every turn, and leaves its mark like
the fever. Mrs. Mathewson, why should Billy go past
himself like this? He&#8217;s so quiet at usual times&mdash;and then
he loses himself in fury at sight of Mr. Gaunt. They say,
of course&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ay,&#8221; put in the widow drily; &#8220;and they say right
once i&#8217; a way. They&#8217;re half-brothers. I should know,
for I kept house for Gaunt&#8217;s father before I was fool
enough to marry Mathewson o&#8217; Ghyll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla did not wish to hear the tale, and yet she stood
there, irresolute, her face half turned to Mrs. Mathewson&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard tell o&#8217; the night when a stranger-woman
came knocking at the door o&#8217; Marshlands?&#8221; The
widow was still regarding Cilla with hard, keen eyes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
it seemed that she, who kept silence with her neighbours
usually, had some purpose behind all this talk. &#8220;Well,
I was cooking supper for Reuben Gaunt&#8217;s father at the
time, and I mind saying to young Reuben, who was larking
i&#8217; the kitchen and nigh teasing the life out o&#8217; me&mdash;he
was fourteen or so then, was Reuben&mdash;I mind saying
to him that it war a night ye couldn&#8217;t find heart to turn a
dog out in. Th&#8217; wind war blowing sleet an&#8217; hail in
sheets agen the window-panes, an&#8217; it war crying down the
chimbleys till ye could hardly see across th&#8217; floor for peat-smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was listening. She had lost all desire to escape.
The widow&#8217;s gaunt, tall figure, the impassive hardness
of her voice as she brought the bygone scene before
Priscilla&#8217;s eyes, were part of the snow and the white
stone fences, part of the falling wind that sobbed through
every cranny of the walls and ruffled the water of the
drinking-pool that divided the two women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; smoke was making me sneeze and cough, but it
warn&#8217;t that made me so mad wi&#8217; &#8217;t. It war spoiling th&#8217;
master&#8217;s supper, an&#8217; his temper war fearful when aught
went wrang i&#8217; th&#8217; house. Well, I needn&#8217;t hev bothered my
head about that, for at that minute there came a rapping
at th&#8217; front door, an&#8217; I ran out into th&#8217; hall to see who it
war. There war a woman standing there, an&#8217; th&#8217; wind
blew her fair indoors, without a by-your-leave, soon as I
lifted th&#8217; sneck. She war nigh as bonnie an&#8217; slim as ye,
Miss Cilla,&#8221; she went on, after a long glance at the other.
&#8220;The master was a fairish judge o&#8217; women i&#8217; that way,
I&#8217;ll own, like his son &#8217;at followed him. She had a bairn
wi&#8217; her&mdash;may be four-year-old&mdash;an&#8217; she wanted the
master; so I called him, after shutting th&#8217; door to keep
all yond mak&#8217; o&#8217; wind out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and looked across the shrouded fields, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
shivered. Hard as she was, the misery of that night
returned to her. Cilla stood waiting silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The master came, an&#8217; looked once at th&#8217; stranger-woman,
an&#8217; a sort o&#8217; devil came into his face. Then I
knew that one of his black moods was on him; for I
was used to the look o&#8217; them. The woman was very pitiful
to look at an&#8217; to listen to, an&#8217; she said she war his wife&mdash;married
by stealth a year after the first mistress died.
I believed her, for my part, an&#8217; a woman can tell most
times when another woman&#8217;s lying. She was plain of her
speech, though, and Reuben&#8217;s father always had a queer
mak o&#8217; pride about him,&mdash;must have a ladyish wife at
Marshlands, or else hide her i&#8217; the haymow out o&#8217; folk&#8217;s
sight. That&#8217;s Reuben&#8217;s way, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla wondered at the sudden bitterness in her
voice, then remembered that this was Peggy&#8217;s mother;
and the widow knew, it was plain, that she was her daughter&#8217;s
rival. Tears of pride and humiliation started to the
girl&#8217;s eyes. It was easier to conquer a secret trouble than
an open one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to shorten a sad tale,&#8221; went on the older woman,
after seeing that her taunt had struck home, &#8220;Mr. Gaunt
turned both mother an&#8217; th&#8217; little lad out into th&#8217; cold;
an&#8217; I could have throttled him for &#8217;t, if he&#8217;d been a thought
less strong. The rest o&#8217; the tale ye know, Miss Cilla.
They found the mother dead on the door-stone, an&#8217; Billy
the Fool war strong enough to weather the cold&mdash;else
he&#8217;d not have been here at the drinking-pool to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla gathered her strength again. &#8220;Why do you tell
me this?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I say, with father, that one
day&#8217;s trouble is enough as it comes, without going back
to the old sorrows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, lile baby? Because I&#8217;ve watched ye an&#8217; Gaunt
go lover-like along the pastures, afore this daft snow came.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Because I want to warn ye that Gaunt comes of a bad
breed, an&#8217; never i&#8217; this world could be aught but a will-o&#8217;-wispie.
Oh, my lass, I&#8217;ve seen a few springs come&mdash;but
I&#8217;ve seen the end o&#8217; such-like nonsense, and I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla laughed, and Widow Mathewson, whose outlook
on the world was impersonal and cold&mdash;save when human
weakness broke down the barriers&mdash;approved this slim
lass in her workaday dress of homespun.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only yesterday that I bade Mr. Gaunt marry
where his heart lay,&#8221; said the girl quietly. &#8220;If I had
cared for him&mdash;after that fashion&mdash;should I have been
glad when he told me he was marrying Peggy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were glad?&#8221; asked the widow, with suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? He is fond of Peggy, and I think that&mdash;that
he will settle down, as a farmer should&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, so I think, too,&#8221; broke in the widow with sudden
feeling. &#8220;I made the worst o&#8217; that bygone tale, I own,
and never told ye that Reuben, on that night when he&#8217;d
been plaguing me i&#8217; the kitchen, crept round into t&#8217; hall,
listening to the stranger-woman&#8217;s tale and seeing her
driven out into the wind. Well, he waited for his father
to go, and then he crept to my side, did th&#8217; lad, an&#8217; we
listened to her as she ligged, crying, just outside th&#8217; door.
Then he pulled up th&#8217; sneck, an&#8217; he war lifting her in when
old Gaunt came, all thunder and lightning down th&#8217; passage.
Gaunt locked th&#8217; stranger-woman and the lad
out o&#8217; doors; an&#8217; he locked Reuben an&#8217; me i&#8217; th&#8217; big,
up-stairs room. &#8217;Twas so we passed the night, Miss
Cilla, but I&#8217;ve a soft spot i&#8217; my heart for th&#8217; lad ever
since, spite of his cantrips.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked across the pool at each other. They were
set about by snow, and moaning of the wind, and white
hills shrouded under mists that made their summits
level with the sky.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;What chance had he?&#8221; said Cilla. &#8220;With such a
father&mdash;oh, he did well that night! He did well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson turned. &#8220;Seems I misjudged ye,
Miss Cilla. I niver can trust a bonnie, lile face like yours
these days. Oh, ay, he may do well enough for Peggy.
Anyway, she&#8217;s set her heart on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Cilla got down to the croft, and reached the
mistal, she found David sitting on an upturned box. He
had a lamb on his knees, and he was feeding it with milk
from a bottle. Billy was standing near, and his face was
wide as a rift in the clouds when the sun breaks through.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been laughing, Miss Good Intent,&#8221; said Billy.
&#8220;Near cracked my sides, I have. Here&#8217;s strong David
feeding a babby as if &#8217;twere his own. Te-he! Ye&#8217;d
never think he was strong at the forge.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was shy. This business of saving lambs from
the snow had seemed natural and easy until Cilla came.
Now he felt clumsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy is right,&#8221; he said, as he handed the lamb and
the bottle to Cilla. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a woman&#8217;s work, this. I was
only waiting till ye came.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late that night when her work was done and the moon
was up above the fells, Cilla unbarred the porch-door and
went out into the raised path that protected the strip of
garden from the highway. The wind had long since
shifted to the south, and quiet Garth looked all like fairy-land.
From the green, young twigs of the beeches,
across the road, the soft snow fell away, showing leaves
half-opened. There was everywhere the sound of gentle
splashing&mdash;wet snow falling on wet snow&mdash;and the
fells beyond were clear of mist. The air was full of
warmth and scent of violets; for it was Garth&#8217;s way to
remedy her spring storms with daintiest blandishments.</p>

<p>Cilla was full of her trouble still. It had been easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to give up her man in the heat of pride and sacrifice;
but she was lonely now. She remembered, as lasses will
when they have good fathers, how often Yeoman Hirst
had cheered her in bad weather with a hearty, &#8220;Oh,
&#8217;twill lift, lass, by and by. Be sure &#8217;twill lift. &#8217;Tis only
nature for the sun to pop out fro&#8217; behind a cloud and take
a body by surprise, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; she said, with a long glance at the hills.
&#8220;Father is right. It always lifts&mdash;but the waiting-time
is hard, just time and time.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the sun began to warm the land again, and the
sheep were crying up and down the pastures, their
lambs beside them, full summer came with a swiftness
rarely known in these grey highlands. The lilacs bloomed
two weeks before their time. The birds let loose their
litanies as if the blue sky and thrust of the green-stuff forward
had not been known till now. Folk moved abroad
with keen sunlight in their eyes, and in their voices a cheery
welcome for their fellows. Even Widow Lister forgot
to fidget, forgot her love of gossip with a spice in it, and
turned instead to tranquil tending of the garden-strip
that fronted her cottage. From the hedgerows and the
fields, from the moors that raked up into the blue arch of
sky, there rose a quiet, insistent song of peace.</p>

<p>Cilla of the Good Intent met Gaunt by chance these
days on the highway, or in half-forgotten bridle-paths that
were young when grey old Garth was in the building&mdash;and
they passed a greeting one to the other, and went their
ways. She was puzzled&mdash;and so was he, had she
guessed the truth&mdash;to note the change in him. He was
less assured than of old; there was shame and appeal in
his eyes when he met her; he seemed to Priscilla like
some big, helpless dog that had lost its way and went
seeking for its home.</p>

<p>Cilla was true daughter to Yeoman Hirst. She might
suffer, but malice went by her like a peevish wind-gust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
that is over and done with as soon as it is past. She
wished no ill to Gaunt, though he had spoiled her first
dream o&#8217; love. She wondered, simply and without overmuch
repining, that her life had grown so empty, that
she no longer cared for the flower-scents and the wood-reek
that guarded Garth village like a benediction.</p>

<p>The year wore on to July, and there had been no rain
since a light April shower that had followed the snowstorm.
The pastures, striding stony limestone hills,
grew parched and brown. With August, and no rain
from the pitiless blue sky, even the brown of the grass was
burnt, and the lightest of warm breezes carried the dust
of the brown way. Far up the crests of the hills there
was no green to soften the white glare of the limestone.
All was pitiless and bare, and lacking any gift of charity.
The sun, at usual times a rare and welcome guest, had
overstepped his welcome now.</p>

<p>A rumour came to Garth these days, and the farmers,
as they rode down the street to market, grew less cheery
in their greetings one to another. They knew, each one
of them, the danger that lay near to their wives and bairns;
and, knowing it, they kept silence, as the way of the hills
is when a tempest shakes them.</p>

<p>Their wives heard the rumour, by and by, and there
was clatter of tongues along the dust of Garth&#8217;s grey
street. Widow Lister, by gift of nature, talked more
shrilly than her sisters, just as she had been the first to
bring the news which no folk cared to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I telled ye so,&#8221; she whispered, running out to meet
Hirst one day as he passed down the street. &#8220;The
Black Fever has come nigh to Garth, and ye wouldn&#8217;t
take no heed. I&#8217;m a lone widow myself, with no one to
care for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ay, but you have!&#8221; Hirst&#8217;s voice was cheery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
still, though it was less boisterous than usual, and behind
it there was a hint of sharp reproof. &#8220;You&#8217;ve yourself
to care for, Widow. That means a lot to ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what do ye mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean this. That folk who have only theirselves
to think on, they forget to think for others. See you
here, Widow, the fever&#8217;s not reached Garth yet. &#8217;Twill
reach it sooner, I warrant ye, if you go scaring timid
women as you&#8217;re scaring &#8217;em each minute o&#8217; the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, now, I&#8217;m to be scolded, am I?&#8221; The widow
brushed a few tears away, and looked up into Hirst&#8217;s face
with the timidity which had always served her well.
&#8220;To be sure, I&#8217;ve no man-body to speak up for me. I
mun bear my crosses meekly, for nobody heeds you much
once you&#8217;re lone and widowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst&#8217;s face, with all its jollity and kindliness, was lined
deep by hardship, by fight in life&#8217;s open with such plain
foes as weather, peevish soil, and foot-rot that attacked
his sheep. The widow&#8217;s was rosy, plump, unmarked save
by such little wrinkles as a baby carries; she had sat
by the hearth all her days, sheltered by four walls, and
death, when it had come to force her from the fireside
warmth to the churchyard and her husband&#8217;s grave, had
been no more than a worry which spoilt her own comfort
for awhile. Yet the round, shining face, looking up into
his, made Yeoman Hirst uneasy this morning; it put him
in the wrong; it made him feel as if he had rebuked a
kitten for playing with a ball of wool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re made as we&#8217;re made, Widow!&#8221; he
cried, preparing to move on. &#8220;I only ask you to listen
when I tell ye what a power o&#8217; harm ye can do by scaring
folk when the fever&#8217;s close at our doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you&#8217;re going to Shepston market, same as if
Shepston hadn&#8217;t got fever in every other house.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Hirst, his jaw set firm. &#8220;There&#8217;s need
to go to Shepston, fever or no, if I&#8217;m to do right by the
farm. There&#8217;s no need for stay-at-homes to chatter
and wake a sleeping dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Lister watched him go through the white,
breathless sunlight, and for once she did not call him
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re strange, is men,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;My own
man was like Hirst&mdash;would run into any sort of danger if
he&#8217;d a whim for it&mdash;yet he&#8217;d grow outrageous as a turkey-cock
if I set my tongue round a lile, soft bit o&#8217; gossip.
Men, they never seem to understand life, poor bodies.
Ah, there&#8217;s David coming up street. He&#8217;s a soft heart,
he. I&#8217;ll just get him to see what ails yond canary bird
o&#8217; mine while he&#8217;s passing.&#8221;</p>

<p>David, however, was impatient. He listened to the
story of the bird&#8217;s ailments, but his air was brisk and
downright, just as Yeoman Hirst&#8217;s had been. A man is
apt to carry that air when he knows how close a danger
lies to his womenfolk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starve him a bit, Widow. Cosset him less by the
hearth, and he&#8217;ll come round, same as other men birds.
I&#8217;ve a bigger job than canaries to see to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the widow did not pursue him as he strode fiercely
up toward Good Intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fever&#8217;s come to Garth a&#8217;ready, I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221;
she murmured dolefully. &#8220;If David&#8217;s lost half o&#8217; the
little wits he had, we&#8217;ve come to a fine pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>David halted when he came to the gate of Good Intent.
His face was full of suffering, and for that reason it showed
a greater dignity. He unfastened the latch with sudden
decision, as if ashamed of his cowardice, and stepped into
the cool, grey porch, and stood at the door of the house-place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Cilla was standing at the table in the full light of the sun
that streamed through the narrow windows, and she was
ironing a lilac frock. She had not heard his step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla!&#8221; he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>She started, and let the iron fall, and did not heed that
it was burning the lilac frock&mdash;the gown which, so short
a while since as this year&#8217;s spring, had pleased Reuben
Gaunt. They stood there&mdash;David on the threshold,
Cilla at the table&mdash;and they looked at each other in
silence, asking some big question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may come in, David,&#8221; she said at last.</p>

<p>He came and stood beside her, took up the iron and set
it on its stand, with the instinct of a good workman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lilac gown is burned, Priscilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has served its time, David. Did you come to
Good Intent just to tell me I was careless with my ironing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, Cilla.&#8221; The smith had grown resolute
again. &#8220;I came to tell you that I&#8217;m sailing Tuesday o&#8217;
next week for Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was stunned for the moment. David had seen her
bonnie since he knew her first, but never bonnie as she was
just now, with the sunlight on her drooping head, her
fingers plucking at the scissors in her girdle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve ta&#8217;en time to make up my mind, I own,&#8221; he went
on stubbornly, &#8220;but &#8217;tis made up now. My aunt Joanna,
overseas yonder, is a lile bit like Widow Lister&mdash;she&#8217;s
helpless without the good man she nagged into his grave,
and she willun&#8217;t take no fro&#8217; me. She&#8217;s fonder o&#8217; nephew
David these days than ever she was when she had him
close under her hand. She wants somewhat done for her,
ye see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla glanced up at him, then down again. &#8220;What&mdash;what
has made you in such haste to leave, David?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;Haste, ye call it? I&#8217;ve been for going ever since April
came in, and putting off makes no job easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be glad to leave Garth, and see bigger countries?&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla could not understand herself. It seemed to
her that she wished to hurt David in some way; she was
surprised, ashamed, that news of his going should have
such power to move her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to leave Garth?&#8221; echoed David, his blue eyes
wide with question. &#8220;Never that, lile Cilla. As &#8217;tis, I
should never have dreamed o&#8217; going, if there&#8217;d been you
to keep me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I keep you, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, lass, don&#8217;t play wi&#8217; me. I cannot bear it. I&#8217;ll
go easier, all the same, for knowing all is finished between
you and Gaunt o&#8217; Marshlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The iron was cold by this time, but Cilla passed it idly
to and fro across the lilac gown. &#8220;Yes, all is finished&mdash;and&mdash;and
I&#8217;m, oh, so glad, David! So very glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>In token of it she burst into tears, and David put an
arm about her. &#8220;Lile lass, lile lass, let me bide i&#8217; Garth.
See the love I&#8217;ll give ye&mdash;asking so little, Cilla, and giving
so much&mdash;giving so much, my lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla looked up slowly, and regarded him with a long,
steady glance. Life was so great a matter, and she was
so weak to cope with it. If David would only give little
to her, and ask her to give much in return&mdash;if he would
be less patient, and more masterful&mdash;if he would find
some way of taking her perplexities into his hands and
riving them to pieces&mdash;if he would be devil-may-care
for once, as Gaunt had been in the spring&mdash;the girl felt,
in a helpless way, that then she might bid him stay in
Garth.</p>

<p>It was their moment, and they let it pass. David was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
too diffident, seeing the girl here in the sunlight, to brush
aside the cobwebs that hindered her true vision. It
needed a rude hand to do it, and David&#8217;s hand was gentle,
as the hands of good men are when they are free of smithy-work.
Cilla was too unsure of everything to yield to a
touch less sure than downright mastery. She waited for
him to speak, and found that he was only looking at her&mdash;a
more honest dog than Gaunt, maybe, but with the
same waiting look in his eyes that Gaunt had carried
since the jaunty days of spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so&mdash;so dumb, David,&#8221; she said impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I was never one to talk much, Cilla. I&#8217;m one to
feel, for all that. Time and time I fancy I&#8217;m a bit like
Billy the Fool&mdash;loving the dust o&#8217; Garth Street when you
walk along it, because &#8217;tis you that passes by, yet never
finding a word to put to &#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla&#8217;s strength was nearly spent. The heat of the
pitiless summer, her loneliness since Gaunt had chosen
otherwise, the constant peril of the Black Fever brooding
round about Garth Village, had sapped her courage.
For a moment she was tempted to yield to David&#8217;s entreaties.
He was so sure of himself, so clean of his heart
and his hands. She liked and needed him.</p>

<p>She remembered Gaunt, recalled each trivial detail of
the day when she had gone by coach to Keta&#8217;s Well,
wearing a maiden heart. She thought of the homeward
walk, of the throstle-calls and the keen, young vigour
of the spring, while Gaunt stepped beside her, and talked
and took her unawares. She shrank in fancy from the
kiss that he had given her at the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, David, no!&#8221; she said. Her eyes were wet, but
she did not fear to look him in the face. &#8220;I&#8217;m not proud
of Reuben Gaunt&mdash;not proud of him at all&mdash;but I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
glad o&#8217; the love I gave him&mdash;though&mdash;though it died,
David.&#8221;</p>

<p>David the Smith took a long glance at the room&mdash;at
the plants in the window-sill, at the settle which had found
him on many a bygone night passing slow talk and quiet
pipe-reek with Yeoman Hirst across the hearth. Then he
looked at Cilla, and stood there&mdash;strong and good to see,
and diffident&mdash;and his air was that of a man who steps
into a church. It had always been his way when Cilla
was in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, good-by, lile Cilla,&#8221; he said abruptly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s much to be done, if I&#8217;m setting off by Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David! David, you must not go like this&mdash;thinking
me unfriendly. David, I could never bear to be unfriendly
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had moved to his side, and in perplexity had laid
both hands upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not understand,&#8221; she went on hurriedly. &#8220;I
shall miss you from Garth. I shall look for you three
times a day. The homeland will be emptier, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, lass, why willun&#8217;t ye wed me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell. Only&mdash;women have no second love
to give. Why it should be so, God knows. But so it is,
David. I could never feel for you&mdash;what I felt for
another when we walked by the field-ways home to Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed strange to Cilla that she felt no shame in the
confession. She would have shrunk from it at another
time; but now it was only of David she thought&mdash;of
David, who asked for more than she could give him&mdash;of
David, who asked for honesty, though she longed to
keep him here in Garth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; he answered quietly. &#8220;Neither man
nor woman has second love to give. But there&#8217;s this to
say, Cilla. Time and time, when you&#8217;re alone on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
moor-top, a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp comes &#8217;ticing ye into the
marshes. True love is true love, lass, and &#8217;tis steady-like;
it doesn&#8217;t dance like a light-heeled clown at the fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla of the Good Intent was tired, and saw life
hidden, as the street of Garth was hidden by the sick,
grey dust that cried to the skies for wholesome rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of Reuben Gaunt?&#8221; she asked
wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, just of Reuben Gaunt&mdash;no more, no less.&#8221;
David was watching her eagerly, not as a lover now, but
with a dog&#8217;s look when he sees his mistress running into
danger.</p>

<p>Cilla thought again of that spring journey out to Keta&#8217;s
Well and home again. It called to her still, like the song
of a laverock up above the pastures when spring is wild
about the land. Gaunt&#8217;s words were in her ear. The
kiss she had given him at the gate&mdash;the sweet of the
growing grass&mdash;the surrender, and the glamour of it,
and the big lands stretching out before her&mdash;Priscilla
remembered every moment of that day. She knew that
David the Smith was right when he named the glamour
a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp; but she did not wish to know it; she
resisted the knowledge with a curious, headstrong passion
that she rarely showed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to part friends?&#8221; she said, in a low, unsteady
voice. &#8220;You choose a queer way of saying good-by.
There was no need to speak of Mr. Gaunt at all, still less
to speak ill of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not like you, Cilla,&#8221; David answered quietly.</p>

<p>She was repentant at once, as her way was always.
&#8220;No, &#8217;tis not like me. You meant it well&mdash;but, David,
you are clumsy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the longing came to her to keep him here in
Garth. The shadow of a great helplessness lay over her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
and from one moment to the next she did not know her
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;David,&#8221; she said, by and by, &#8220;do you guess what they
will say if you leave Garth now, with the fever all about
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never try to guess what they&#8217;ll say, lass. What I do
is enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla, still hating this random mood of hers, could not
hold back the words. &#8220;They&#8217;ll say you choose your
time for leaving carefully, after thinking about it all these
months. They&#8217;ll say you are as frightened of the fever
as other folk. They&#8217;ll say&mdash;that you&#8217;re a coward,
David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be liars, then, Cilla. I&#8217;m a man o&#8217; my hands,
lile lass, and I&#8217;ve learned a little here and there fro&#8217; my
tools. Iron&#8217;s stubborn, and needs patience, but there&#8217;s
luck, somehow, when ye&#8217;ve hammered the horseshoe into
shape. As for the fever&mdash;well, it finds ye, or it doesn&#8217;t,
and that&#8217;s i&#8217; God&#8217;s hands. I&#8217;m a bit daft, like Billy the
Fool. The day&#8217;s work is enough for me&mdash;Billy calls it
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla looked at him for a moment, as a child looks
for a guiding hand. &#8220;I&mdash;I was wrong to say that,
David. No one dare say that you were frightened.
David, what ails me that I want to quarrel with my oldest
friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the heat, Cilla. We&#8217;re all wearied out, I
reckon. Quarrel wi&#8217; me? You could as well quarrel wi&#8217;
yond grandfather&#8217;s clock i&#8217; the corner, while &#8217;tis saying
<i>tick-tack</i> to ye all day long and never changes tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla laughed uneasily. &#8220;That is the reason, maybe.
I love the old clock, but sometimes&mdash;oh, David, I&#8217;m
weary of its notes sometimes&mdash;and yet I should cry my
heart out if&mdash;if the clock was not ticking in the corner.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>He should have seen her need of guidance, should have
taken her random hint that he might try a change of note&mdash;even
if his voice were unaccustomed to it and sounded
out of tune. But David had made up his mind that
morning, after long indecision, and his face was set
toward the lonely lands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best listen to the old clock, for all that, Cilla. It
doesn&#8217;t go fast, but it goes for a long while. Well, there&#8217;s
a deal to be done, if I&#8217;m to get off by Tuesday o&#8217; next
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a last glance at Cilla, at the house-place, at
the lilac frock that lay on the ironing-board; and without
a word he stepped out into the dusty street. And, after
he had gone, Priscilla of the Good Intent sat down at the
table, and laid her head on it, and sobbed bitterly; but
whether the tears were for David, or for herself, she did not
know.</p>

<p>David went down the street. He carried a big air;
and his face, if sad at all, wore only the dignity of grief,
none of its meanness or self-pity.</p>

<p>He found Billy leaning against the door of the forge.
Billy, thinking the more because he said so little, had
watched the smith go up the street, had divined his errand
by the same instinct which befriended him in his comradeship
with birds and beasts; and now he knew from
one glance at David&#8217;s face what was in the doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be leaving this right pleasant spot, David the
Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>David was too accustomed to the other&#8217;s intuition to
feel surprise. &#8220;Ay, I&#8217;m leaving Garth. And, lad, I&#8217;ve
something to say to ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, have ye a fill o&#8217; baccy, an&#8217; may be a lile
match or so to light yond same? Smoke&#8217;s a fearful help
to a daft body&#8217;s head-piece.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The smith waited till Billy was drawing tranquil puffs&mdash;and
indeed no man in Garth knew better how to smoke
a pipe with true respect&mdash;then put a hand against the
smithy wall, and leaned there, a figure of strength and of
self-reliance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like the forge to pass into other hands,
Billy. There&#8217;s been one o&#8217; my name here since the Year
One, or nigh about, and &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t be seemly-like, to see
another name above the door. Now, see ye, lad, suppose
we called it play, ye and me, to set ye here as master-smith?
&#8217;Tis ever so much more play-work than blowing
bellows, come to think on&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he!&#8221; laughed Billy. &#8220;Am I to play wi&#8217; all your
big, fine tools, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, just that I&#8217;ve taught ye the way o&#8217; them, and
Dan Foster&#8217;s lad from Brow Farm shall come and blow
the bellows for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that be work for Dan Foster&#8217;s lad, or play?&#8221;</p>

<p>David caught the other&#8217;s meaning, with a quickness that
he might well have shown when saying good-by to Cilla.
&#8220;Hard work, Billy&mdash;grievous hard work, while you&#8217;re
just playing at making horseshoes, fence-railings, and
what not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m to play at making horseshoes?&#8221; went on
Fool Billy, smoking quietly into the face of the stark,
blue sky and the heat of the midday sun. &#8220;I&#8217;m to play
at smithy-work, while Dan Foster&#8217;s lad&#8217;s sweating hard
at bellows-blowing?&#8221;</p>

<p>David nodded as he filled his own pipe and lit it, leaning
against the smithy wall. &#8220;It will be rare fun for ye,
Billy&mdash;the lad working hard as ever he can sweat at the
blowing, and ye just pleasuring wi&#8217; making good horseshoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will that!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Fancied bellows-blowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
was pastime, I, but now I see it quite contrary-like. Dan
Foster&#8217;s lad will be Fool Billy, sweating at the bellows,
and I shall be master-man. Te-he, David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, te-he!&#8221; growled David. &#8220;Get the bellows
a-blowing, Billy, for there&#8217;s work needs doing if I&#8217;m to get
off by Tuesday o&#8217; next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy obeyed. He had little gift of speech, but had the
rarer quality of sympathy; and he knew, in his own odd
way, how matters stood with the master of the forge.</p>

<p>The smith did not move from his place against the wall
until his pipe was smoked out. Then he gave a glance
along the dust of Garth in the direction of Good Intent,
and went into the forge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met odd folk and queer happenings i&#8217; my time,&#8221;
he said to Billy, who was making the bellows roar; &#8220;but
the queerest o&#8217; the lot is life itself&mdash;just life as we&#8217;re
living it, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy answered nothing, but played gently with the
bellows. And David worked fiercely at the anvil. And
the sick, dusty afternoon wore on, bidding all who had
time for idle thoughts to remember how near the Black
Fever lay to Garth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DAVID the Smith caught the morning coach on the
Tuesday, though he had all but missed it through
remembering a bit of smithy-work that must be finished
off before he left for Canada. That was David&#8217;s way;
he would not leave Garth owing the smallest debt to any
man, and promises of work to be finished to the hour
were always counted debts of honour by David.</p>

<p>There was a little crowd about the Elm Tree Inn, and
up above the folks&#8217; heads he could see Will, the mail-driver,
sitting high on the box seat of the coach, and showing
signs of good-humoured impatience to be off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, David!&#8221; called the driver, catching sight of the
other a hundred yards away. &#8220;Ye be i&#8217; no hurry to
leave Garth, but Will the Driver is. I carry the Queen&#8217;s
letters, and Her Majesty&mdash;God bless her&mdash;will want
to know why I&#8217;m late wi&#8217; her post-bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was sorrowful enough, but he did not mean to
let Garth know it. He held his head high, and did not
quicken his steady forward stride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the Queen willun&#8217;t mind, Will,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Just tell her it was David the Smith who kept her waiting,
and she&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shade of perplexity crossed his face as he neared the
knot of folk who pressed round the coach. There were
apt to be idlers about the inn-front at this hour, since the
passing of the mail was the big adventure of each day&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
tranquil round; but this morning there was clearly something
unusual on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked David. &#8220;Is there a wedding
or a fairing Shepston way, and me not heard of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then it was brought home to him that he was the
centre of the crowd, and he flushed like a great, shy lad
to find himself a hero. Their welcome was so spontaneous,
their affection so simple and so boisterous, that
David&#8217;s modesty was shocked. David had been accustomed
to do his work in Garth, to walk up and down its
street with the proud and ready courtesy of a man whose
hands are strong and whose heart is clean; and the village
had accepted his presence as it accepted the sun when it
shone, or the rain when it watered their growing crops.
It was only now, at the parting of the ways, that Garth
fully understood what it was losing.</p>

<p>Will the Driver gave the folk little time to show their
feelings. He had kept the seat beside him on the box for
David&mdash;if seat it could be called, seeing that most of it
was littered by mail-bags picked up from half-a-dozen
scattered villages&mdash;and he motioned to David to clamber
up by the fore-wheel. The crowd would not allow it,
though, and lifted him with a &#8220;Heave ho! All together,
lads!&#8221; And David was thankful that the mail-bags
broke his fall a little as he was hoisted into his seat.</p>

<p>The hampers were passed up, and small, round butter-baskets,
and parcels wrapped clumsily in thick brown
paper. Each was a tribute from some one among the
villagers who had felt no need till now to express his regard
for the smith; and each had a dozen eggs in it, or a
spice-loaf, or some other farewell gift of viands, until
David broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, lads, nay!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;&#8217;Twill take another
horse to help pull all these parcels to Shepston&mdash;let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
alone a few odd men to help me get through wi&#8217; what&#8217;s
inside them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tuts!&#8221; roared Farmer Hirst, striving to cover
his grief that David had insisted on leaving Garth. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
a long step and a far step fro&#8217; Garth to Canada. Ye may
varry weel be hungry &#8217;twixt this and there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Queen&#8217;s waiting,&#8221; said Will the Driver, as he
flicked the mail-bags with the end of his whip.</p>

<p>Cilla slipped from the shelter of her father&#8217;s shoulders,
and came and reached up a hand to David. He could
make nothing of the girl&#8217;s face, for it was both gay and
downcast. He felt something slipped into his palm,
he heard her bid him a quiet farewell, and she was gone.
The team of three started forward, and a shrill cry came
to them from behind.</p>

<p>Will the Driver pulled up, as if by instinct&mdash;an instinct
he despised&mdash;and Widow Lister ran panting to
the coach. She brought no gift, but then no one would
expect such from a widow-body.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t let ye go without saying good-by, David,&#8221;
she said, out of breath. &#8220;Besides, I want ye to take a
message to your aunt Joanna yonder i&#8217; Canada. &#8217;Tis
fifteen years and a day since she borrowed a saucepan fro&#8217;
me, and went off at her marriage, and forgot to return it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Widow, we&#8217;re late,&#8221; said Will, his good temper near
to the breaking point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but&mdash;David&mdash;tell Joanna it isn&#8217;t as I want
the saucepan back&mdash;&#8217;tis burned through t&#8217; bottom by
now, no doubt&mdash;but I&#8217;m not one to like bearing a grudge
all these years. If she&#8217;d only say she war sorry,
now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver flicked his team, and the white road slipped
behind them, and David had started on the track to
Canada.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>For a half-mile Will was silent. Then he spoke, looking
steadily at his horses&#8217; ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me that one o&#8217; two things is bound to happen,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Either Widow Lister is going to leave
the road, or I am. There&#8217;s not room for the two of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited for David&#8217;s answer; and, getting none, went
forward with his grievance, not troubling to turn his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman that can carry a saucepan grudge for fifteen
years&mdash;gee up, lass Polly, we&#8217;ve time to make up!&mdash;is
a woman that cannot help scaring a man. &#8217;Tis not
just that,&#8221; he broke off, still flicking the ears of his team
with a gentle, contemplative whip, as if he were casting
for trout, &#8220;&#8217;tis not just that bothers me. &#8217;Tis her durned,
queer way o&#8217; being out o&#8217; breath, and growing plumper on
&#8217;t every day, an&#8217; holding up the mail three days out o&#8217;
the seven, year in, year out. And the widow allus chooses
her three days&mdash;days when we chance to be late, I
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dust went by them faster and faster; for Will
prided himself on reaching Shepston to the minute,
though he hated this overdriving of good cattle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The widow&#8217;s never grown up,&#8221; he went on, cheerful
and happy-go-lucky again, now that he had vented his
grievance. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be a bairn o&#8217; six years old till she dies.
That&#8217;s her ailment, and that&#8217;s why we humour her,
I reckon. Yet she married a fairish sensible man, and
ought to have learned summat by now. Gee-up, lass
Polly. We&#8217;ve time to make up, I say. She was left a
widow too young, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another mile went by, broken only by a farm lass who
held up the coach like a gentle highwayman, handed a
letter and a penny to the driver, and smiled at him. The
outlying farmsteads posted their letters in this haphazard
way, and neither the driver nor the maid said a word to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
each other; they were too friendly to need words, as it
chanced, for Will was pledged to marry her within a
month or two.</p>

<p>The next mile passed them, dusty and white. The sun
beat down, and there was not a friendly cloud to hide the
pitiless blue of the sky. It was no friendly blue, such as
pansies wear, when times go hard and the cool, quiet
flowers look at a man with eyes of pity; it was a cold light
and a hard light, for all its warmth, this never-ending sky
that kept the Black Fever close to Garth&#8217;s borders.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no good news fro&#8217; Shepston, David,&#8221; said
Will, by and by. &#8220;Every day there&#8217;s the same tale when
I drive in&mdash;more folk down wi&#8217; fever, and bodies waiting
to be buried because the coffiners are feared to go nigh
them. I&#8217;m tough myself, but I&#8217;m getting a lile bit nervous.
They never stop talking on&#8217;t, ye see, i&#8217;stead o&#8217;
letting it be, and a man can&#8217;t help thinking o&#8217; what&#8217;s being
dinned into his ears by every body he meets. Bless me,&#8221;
he broke off, with a quiet laugh, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got that bad I&#8217;m
finding myself looking at Shepston passengers when they
get aboard the mail&mdash;looking to see if there&#8217;s any sure
mark of the fever on their faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion was still silent, and at last it struck
Will that something was amiss. He turned his head,
and checked his flow of gossip suddenly; he had not seen
steady David in this mood before.</p>

<p>A half-mile out from Garth, the smith had opened his
right hand, had glanced eagerly to see what parting gift
Cilla had left there when she said good-by. He found
a sprig of rosemary, and, because he had held it so long
in his hot palm, half fearing to look at it, the scent of the
herb stole up to him.</p>

<p>It was the scent that drove David&#8217;s wits astray, that
rendered him deaf to Will&#8217;s chatter, blind to the garish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
road in front of him. It meant so much, now that Garth
was left behind; it brought each corner of the old, grey
street to mind. He could scent again the wood-reek curling
sleepily from chimney-stacks of twenty shapes and
sizes, the wallflowers blooming in Widow Lister&#8217;s strip
of garden, the strong, lusty smell of the forge when his
hammer rang on red-hot iron. A sickness to return laid
hold of him; the rosemary had given its message, and
David was fighting with his impulse to get down from
the coach and tramp home again to Garth.</p>

<p>Then another thought came to him. Who did not
know that rosemary stood for remembrance? There was
not a child in Garth but could have told him what the
herb&#8217;s meaning was. In some special way, rosemary had
been, time out of mind, the guardian herb of Garth;
it grew in every garden; it grew along the street front,
wherever a strip of soil had been rescued from the highway.
Without rosemary, the village would not know its
own face; and Garth folk, when they wished to praise
Cilla overmuch behind her back, said that she was just
like rosemary.</p>

<p>Did she wish him to return? Had she chosen this
maidenly token of a change of mind? Little wonder that
David could find no answer; for Cilla herself, in these
days of trouble and indecision, could have given him
none. Will had talked of the widow, of the fever, and
what not; but David had sat with folded arms, watching
the road slip by and trying to grasp his purpose, one way
or the other.</p>

<p>It was the turning-point of Cilla&#8217;s life and his; and
once again modesty played him an ill turn. He was a big
fool, he told himself, to go thinking Cilla would marry
a dull, workaday fellow; she was made for daintier wooing
than he could give. Oh, ay, to be sure she liked him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
well enough, and remembrance meant just that&mdash;no
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me ye&#8217;re in t&#8217; middle of a day-dream,
David,&#8221; said the driver, after a long look at him.</p>

<p>David pulled himself together, and his slow, patient
smile broke across the firmness of his lips. &#8220;I was,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;And now I&#8217;m out o&#8217; the dream, Will.
They want no wool-gatherers out in Canada yonder, so
they tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And ye never heard a word o&#8217; what I said about the
Black Fever? &#8217;Tis all varry weel for ye who&#8217;re leaving
it, but I tell ye I&#8217;m glad to get out o&#8217; Shepston every morn,
and see the fells looking clean and wholesome-like&mdash;though,
bless me, I&#8217;ve nigh begun to look at their faces,
too, to see if there be any mulberry patches on &#8217;em. Mulberry
patches, David&mdash;Shepston folk won&#8217;t let ye forget
the fever-signs. Gee-up, mare Polly! We&#8217;re late,
and the Queen&#8217;s waiting for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for me,&#8221; said David, &#8220;I look on the fever this
way. Ye get it, an&#8217; ye die, or ye don&#8217;t get it, and ye live;
either way, what&#8217;s bound to happen is going to come, and
crying won&#8217;t mend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; assented the driver cheerily, after due
consideration of the point. &#8220;Be durned, David, ye&#8217;ve
a gift o&#8217; common sense. Thought I had the gift, too,
till I took to looking for mulberry patches i&#8217; honest people&#8217;s
faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they neared Shepston, the smith turned for a last
look at the hills raking up into the white-hot limestone
glare that beat upon the dale he loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis good-by, I reckon, lile lass Cilla,&#8221; was his
thought.</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt had not joined the company that met
to give David a farewell at the inn. With all his fickleness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
he was not a liar, and he disdained to make a show
of friendship, when he knew that there was open enmity.
Instead, he remembered that it was Linsall Fair-day,
and he walked up the moor to Ghyll Farm.</p>

<p>Gaunt found the farm-door open, and stepped in.
Peggy Mathewson was busy baking bread, and she looked
hot and tired. The heat of the kitchen, the smell of the
loaves, drove Gaunt into the shelter of the porch again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew! I thought &#8217;twould be cooler indoors than out,
Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did ye? My temper&#8217;s not cool, to begin with, Reuben&mdash;or
should I say &#8216;Mr. Gaunt&#8217; these days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to know. Ye change so often, and your station
varies so&mdash;now marrying proud little Good Intent, and
then again bending down to take notice o&#8217; Peggy Mathewson&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a cure for your temper, Peggy,&#8221; he said, with an
easy laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go to Linsall, and your loaves can
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why to Linsall?&#8221; she asked, with a longing glance
at the moor. &#8220;Oh, ay, &#8217;tis Fair-day. I&#8217;ve nigh forgotten
fairs, and ribbons, and sich-like idleness, since
you came home again. What wi&#8217; work, an&#8217; what wi&#8217;
trying to keep up wi&#8217; your cantrips, Reuben, I&#8217;m a busy
lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>He only laughed and switched his leggings with the
riding-crop, which from sheer habit he was carrying.
The girl&#8217;s tongue might be bitter, but her eyes told another
tale. &#8220;Let&#8217;s away, Peggy. A scamper always does
you good. As for the baking&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s finished,&#8221; she broke in, setting down the last
batch of loaves from the oven; &#8220;and if it weren&#8217;t&mdash;why,
I fancy I shouldn&#8217;t heed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>The old recklessness was in her voice, the old longing
for light-heartedness, though under it all she knew that
there was grief and heaviness. She went up-stairs and
was down again before Gaunt had time to grow impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I shame ye at the Fair?&#8221; she demanded,
standing frankly for his inspection, her colour heightened,
her hands resting on her hips.</p>

<p>Reuben noted the red scarf, the touches of colour which
she had added deftly here and there to a dress which had
seen many fairs and many weathers. No other lass could
have worn such colours. They were gypsyish, bold,
reckless, like Peggy herself, and they seemed to add to her
beauty and her self-assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame me?&#8221; laughed Reuben. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be eyes
for none but ye at Linsall!&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed the porch-door behind her and stepped out
into the sunlight. &#8220;&#8217;Twill be enough for me if I keep
<i>your</i> eyes fro&#8217; roaming for a whole day at a stretch. Eh,
well, I&#8217;m a fool to go wi&#8217; ye, and mother &#8217;ull wonder
what&#8217;s getten me when she comes back fro&#8217; selling eggs
i&#8217; Garth. But then she&#8217;s used to wondering, is mother,&#8221;
the girl added, with a sudden, hard wistfulness in
her voice; &#8220;it seems to come natural to us Mathewsons.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they breasted the moor, however, Peggy&#8217;s spirits
rose. She had a day&#8217;s freedom before her&mdash;and Reuben&#8217;s
company&mdash;and there was no need to vex herself
with the question why he, and he alone, had power to
take her natural good sense away.</p>

<p>They followed one of those winding moor-roads, set
between low banks of bilberry and ling and wild thyme,
which seem ever to hide some swift adventure at the next
turning. Peggy, bred in the midst of these wide, sweeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
uplands, had found all her childish fairy-tales, all her
make-believe of battle and romance, among the moors.
The gypsy wildness in her needed colour, warmth, the
speed of strange adventures; as a child, and later as a
woman, she had peopled the heath with voices other than
the curlew&#8217;s and the plover&#8217;s. The countless hollows,
bottomed by rank mosses and deep bracken, hid ambushed
men; behind each hillock that concealed the track from
her, she would look for some figure to come riding down
to meet her, and no toil about the farm, no harshness of
the workaday life which hemmed her in at Ghyll, had
killed this glamour of the heath. It was this need of glamour,
maybe, which had bidden her long ago to set her
heart on Gaunt; the man&#8217;s queer eyes, with the look in
them of devilry and yet of boyish surprise at life, his
irresolution, the very uncertainty from one day to the next
whether he would come tame to her hand, or would be
wooing elsewhere, all enticed Peggy, as the winding hill-tracks
did, that promised some gallant meeting at the
next corner&mdash;always at the next corner.</p>

<p>To-day she looked neither forward nor behind. She
crossed the moor with feet as light as Gaunt&#8217;s, and he
laughed when they reached the top and halted to take
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just a wild moor-bird, Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not, Reuben; I was hatched in a moor-nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day&#8217;s heat had brought its own recompense in
a measure, for a haze was creeping up from the heath,
softening the glare. The breeze was quick up here, and
almost cool. Far down below them they could see Linsall
village and its bridge, resting like a small, grey Paradise
in the cup of the tall hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were hatched in the pastures,&#8221; went on Widow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Mathewson&#8217;s lass, after a silence. &#8220;There&#8217;s a difference
always &#8217;twixt moor nestlings and pasture birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know! I&#8217;m fond o&#8217; the moor, myself&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, fond&mdash;fondish, as ye are o&#8217; women&mdash;but&mdash;eh,
lad, ye&#8217;ve no love o&#8217; the heather, and the smell of a
marsh when it yields to your foot and all but gets ye
under. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t the same to ye, Reuben. Ye&#8217;ve always
a back-thought for the pastures, green i&#8217; winter an&#8217; green
i&#8217; spring, and never a change. They&#8217;re snugger, Reuben,
and snugness was always to your liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt only laughed, and they ran down the track, hand
in hand, till they reached the wall that guarded the intaken
fields. Linsall village was bigger to them now,
and they could see that it was thick with folk.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be dancing on the green to-night?&#8221; said
Peggy, after they had climbed the wall and were walking
soberly down the long, raking field that led them to the
Linsall road. &#8220;Well, I feel like dancing, Reuben. My
feet were never so light under me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now, be quiet!&#8221; muttered Reuben, with a touch
of superstition and a passing sense of disquiet. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not near a rowan-tree, Peggy, to touch it for luck when we
boast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll risk it, Reuben! I seem to have no wish at all,
save just to dance and dance wi&#8217; ye on Linsall Green.
&#8217;Tis my head, maybe, that&#8217;s light and not my heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were on the road now, and Peggy&#8217;s mood grew
lighter still as she saw the booths, the tents, the knots
of chattering country folk that covered Linsall Green.
She relished the open admiration shown her as she passed;
she welcomed the sly gibes of a few ill-natured and
plainer women; for she knew that Reuben would like her
better if she were the admitted beauty of the day. This
strapping lass with the clear judgment and the capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
hands whenever life&#8217;s work had to be done, was in playtime
as simple as a child. Gaunt was her good fairy to-day;
she loved him with a passionate devotion that surprised
her in quieter moments; in all things to-day she
wished to please him.</p>

<p>They went into the tavern whose front stretched orderly,
and long, and grey, the whole width of the green. Gaunt
made her drink red wine with their meal; the taste of it
was thin and reedy to Peggy, but she understood vaguely
that Reuben thought it a fine thing he was doing. The
glass from which she drank it, was shapelier, too, than any
she had seen, and she praised the wine, and the meal,
and the sunlight that lay white on the white street outside
the window.</p>

<p>Peggy laughed quietly as they went out into the glare
again. &#8220;If I never enjoy a day again,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I
mean to take my fill o&#8217; this one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Gaunt felt a touch of uneasiness but shrugged
his shoulders, as his way was, and thought no more of it.
If he had been bred nearer to the Border, he would have
said that Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s was fey; as it was, he
wondered that he had played yes-and-no with this girl.
Her beauty, her high spirits, the disregard she showed
for all admiration but his own, were pleasant to the man.
For months he had been playing with his promise to
Cilla of the Good Intent that he would marry Peggy.
Well, who knew what might happen on this fine day in
Linsall?</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy,&#8221; he said, as they threaded their way across the
green, &#8220;you need a string of corals round your neck,
to set off all the bonnie rest o&#8217; you. I saw a necklace as
we came past the far booth yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>And a wonderful booth it was, this wooden counter set
on trestles, with a span of canvas overhead to keep sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
or rain away. There were toys on it, and flat-irons,
and housewives&#8217; &#8220;find-alls;&#8221; there were wooden pipes
and clay pipes, and snuff boxes. Betrothal rings, and
wedding rings, and teething rings, lay neighbours to
packets of simples warranted to remedy many ailments.
The whole sum of life&mdash;its hopes, its absurdities, its
random search after pleasure or after ease from pain&mdash;seemed
to lie within the narrow confines of the booth.</p>

<p>Gaunt took down one of the coral necklaces, and the
woman standing behind the counter gave the pair of them
a keen glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; asked Gaunt.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s thoughts were rapid. Were they brother
and sister? No! It would have been sixpence in that
case. Had he just met with the girl, and was he playing
with a fancy? She thought not. That would have meant
a shilling. Were they newly-pledged to each other?</p>

<p>&#8220;Half a crown,&#8221; said the woman quietly. &#8220;They&#8217;re
the best coral money can buy, and I can only sell &#8217;em
so cheap as that because&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; put in Gaunt drily. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the money.
Now, Peggy, let me fasten it on for you&mdash;there! I told
you &#8217;twas all that was needed to set off the rest o&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy felt a touch on her arm, and turned to find a
plump rascal, with a pedlar&#8217;s tray in front of him. His
face, a dusky red at all times&mdash;what between weather
outside inn-walls and warmer cheer within them&mdash;was
a deeper colour than its wont this morning, though his
eyes were quick and roguish, and his spirits gay as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s, come away from
the booth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mother Lambert there has to pay
for her stall, and the keep of a horse to drag it about fro&#8217;
place to place. Stands to reason her wares are dear to
buy. Now, Pedlar Joe is his own pony&mdash;carries his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
booth in front of him, i&#8217; a manner o&#8217; speaking&mdash;and
can afford to sell things cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; put in Mother Lambert tartly from behind her
booth, &#8220;cheap to buy, and dear when ye&#8217;ve got &#8217;em. We
all know <i>your</i> wares, Pedlar Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pedlar sighed, and mutely called the high fells
to witness that he needed no defence. &#8220;Women are
that jealous,&#8221; he observed. Then, with a whimsical
glance at Reuben, &#8220;Mr. Gaunt, &#8217;tis ye that&#8217;s brought
the Pride o&#8217; the Fair to Linsall. Ye&#8217;ll have to buy her
one of these lile scarfs. Peggy&#8217;s fond o&#8217; bright colours, as
she&#8217;s a right to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed as he put his hand in his pocket, for
the pedlar was as well-known for twenty miles around as
Kilnhope Crag, and he came and went like the wind, a
chartered libertine. &#8220;Fond of bright colours, is she?
Like your face, Joe, I take it. And, by that token,
you&#8217;ve been polishing your face a little more than the
ordinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;ve been out i&#8217; the sun more nor usual,&#8221; said
the other shamelessly. &#8220;Wonderful chap, the sun is,
for giving good colour to a body&#8217;s face. Now, Peggy,
see this crimson scarf here; for old times&#8217; sake, Mr.
Gaunt, ye shall have it cheap for three-and-six.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say one-and-six,&#8221; suggested Gaunt lazily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said Joe with dignity. &#8220;I may be poor, sir,
but I don&#8217;t go bargaining when there&#8217;s a lady nigh.
Three-and-six I said, and <i>two</i>-and-six I stick to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy and Gaunt moved away, as soon as the bargain
was completed, and Pedlar Joe strolled up to the booth.
Mother Lambert and he were good friends enough, despite
professional rivalry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if Gaunt and wild-bird Peggy might make a
match of it, after all?&#8221; he hazarded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;So that&#8217;s Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s?&#8221; answered the
booth-woman. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not been nigh Linsall for four or
five years, as ye know, and the lass was a little &#8217;un then.
I&#8217;d forgotten her. But Gaunt&mdash;there&#8217;s no forgetting
him. Maybe he&#8217;s caught at last. I had the same fancy
when I saw &#8217;em step over the green.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; chuckled the pedlar. &#8220;There&#8217;s allus a
&#8216;maybe&#8217; when folk mention Reuben Gaunt. Reuben&mdash;it
means summat like water, if I call to mind&mdash;water
that&#8217;s aye running under the brigg i&#8217;stead o&#8217; crossing it
to find a bit o&#8217; safe-sure ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Lambert began to arrange her wares afresh.
&#8220;Ay, like yourself, Joe&mdash;just like yourself. A caravan
and a horse are steady matters, but a man wi&#8217; a naked
pack on his back should go by the name o&#8217; Reuben.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then these two, vagrants both, fell into argument.
Mother Lambert held the landed view of life, as befitted
one who had a caravan and the right to fix her booth on
the green for this one day. Pedlar Joe argued nimbly
for the honour of his calling, and his views were those
of the unlanded folk, coloured through and through by
talk of freedom, of leisure in which to snare game&mdash;as
being no man&#8217;s property in special&mdash;and of the joys attending
one who, day in day out, had only his pack and
himself to think of.</p>

<p>The dispute was ended only when Joe caught sight
of a country lass, with a pretty face and an air of foolish
vanity about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve to sell a scarf to Nancy Wood,&#8221; he said, with a
confidential wink at the booth-woman. &#8220;She&#8217;s prattlesome
now, and will buy; but she&#8217;ll have no heart for &#8217;t
once she&#8217;s seen Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pedlar sold his scarf; and the sun got down, half
between noon and setting; and still the folk came pouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
into Linsall. There was little news of the fever on this
side of the moor-ridge; and, if there had been news, it
would have been disregarded on this day when all the
countryside was pledged to merriment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re blithe, Peggy!&#8221; said Gaunt, as they moved
about the green together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be,&#8221; she answered, with a heedless laugh.
&#8220;I&#8217;m free for a day&mdash;and I&#8217;m holding both hands out
to catch whatever frolic comes.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LINSALL was staid enough throughout the year;
but, like Peggy Mathewson, she made the most of
her big holiday. The cobbled inn-front, wide as it was,
could hold no more farmers&#8217; gigs; the stable-yard was
full of traps; and those who rode in late on sturdy horses
were forced to seek billets for their nags wherever a
friendly farmstead offered hospitality.</p>

<p>The bridge, arched like a delicate, grey eyebrow above
the peat-brown river, was white with faces which looked
constantly toward the inn, as if watching for some spectacle.
The Squire was there, and his womenfolk, rubbing
shoulders with yeomen and their wives; farm-hands
pressed close against the stonework of the bridge, and
held their bairns to see what was going forward. The
Green below was crowded, too, and men were running up
the pastures that stepped briskly from the roadway to
the moor. Only the road itself, from the fields right
down to the inn-front, was clear of onlookers; and the
dust of the highway showed hot and white as it made a
lane between the folk.</p>

<p>It was time for the fell-race, and there were few dwellers
in this land of climbing fields and overtopping hills
whose hearts did not beat faster at prospect of the race.
Of all their sports it was most in keeping with their daily
lives. Each farmer, when he went to call the cattle into
mistal, when he ploughed or won the hay-crop, was compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
to do his share of climbing; for all the fields at
Linsall, save a few that lay along the river&#8217;s level, strode
straight up-hill, straight down and up again. This fell-race
indeed, was not so much a pastime as a test of endurance
which has grown naturally out of their daily occupation,
and the winner of it was counted the great man
of the year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; said Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s, slipping a
hand through his arm as they stood on the green, &#8220;the
race is to start i&#8217; less than a half-hour, and I&#8217;ve a fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s know it, lass. &#8217;Tis not to-day I&#8217;m saying no
to you, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must run, Reuben&mdash;and you must win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re jesting? Why, I&#8217;m all out of practice&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re tough and hard! I&#8217;ve only to look at you
to see you&#8217;re in condition. You used to win it easy
enough i&#8217; the old days, Reuben&mdash;try, just to please me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed good-naturedly, and began to push
a way through the crowd. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, Peggy; but
I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be best pleased if I come home second, after
being reckoned an easy first so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He borrowed running-gear from the landlord of the
inn, and a low hum went up from the crowd when they
saw him step out again into the sunlight. For it was known
that one of the big fell-racers from the Lake Country had
entered for to-day&#8217;s struggle, and until now there had
seemed no chance that Linsall could keep the honour
within its own borders. At a meeting less happy-go-lucky
and more set about with rules than this, there
might have been trouble touching Gaunt&#8217;s late entry.
But Linsall&#8217;s rule was that, till the moment when the
starter shouted &#8220;Go,&#8221; any man was free to take his
place along the line of combatants.</p>

<p>As Gaunt moved quietly to his place, he was stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
by a shabby-genteel man, whose appearance seemed oddly
out of keeping with the ruddy farmer-folk about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, Mr. Gaunt, but you mean to run to-day?&#8221;
whispered the stranger.</p>

<p>Gaunt nodded; he had followed horse-racing too long
to have any doubt as to what was coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll upset all our bets, then, and poor men have
to make their living. See, now, Mr. Gaunt, you&#8217;re well
off, I know, but the richest need more, and if you&#8217;d a
mind to fall out o&#8217; the race&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben Gaunt, if by force of nature a crooked man
when his affections were in case, was scrupulously straight
in other matters; he had a plentiful lack of self-guidance,
but no meanness; and the suggestion of the shabby-genteel
man touched his temper to the quick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, lads,&#8221; he broke in, turning to the group of
strapping lads who stood nearest to him. &#8220;Here&#8217;s one
who wants me to run crooked for sake of a five pound
note. Just cool his heels for him in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all over before the crowd had time to realize
the meaning of the uproar. The intruder into Linsall&#8217;s
peace was carried at a running pace to the pool under the
bridge, was thrown in and seen to clamber up the further
bank and seek cover like a fox. The farm-lads laughed
and shrugged their shoulders, and went back to
see the start of the race. They had upheld Linsall&#8217;s
reputation for a race run fairly and with keenness, and
there was little chance that other out-at-elbows gentry
would try to-day to disturb that reputation.</p>

<p>Gaunt took his place on the starting line. There were
nine of them&mdash;lean and wiry fellows all, since upland
farming seldom makes for too much flesh&mdash;and next to
Reuben was the Lake Country runner, Bownas by name.
Long in limb, lithe and spare in the body, he dwarfed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Gaunt by a good four inches, and seemed built for this
business of capturing the race.</p>

<p>There were five minutes to go before the signal for the
start, and Bownas looked Gaunt up and down. Finally,
he put out a hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Mr. Gaunt? Pleased to run against ye. I&#8217;ve
heard o&#8217; ye. Better a tough race than a slack one any
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt&#8217;s spirits were rising every moment. He laughed
as he took the other&#8217;s hand. &#8220;By the Lord, we&#8217;ll show
them what running means, if they&#8217;ve never known it
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was heartened by the murmurs of the crowd behind
him. &#8220;Gaunt&#8217;s running to-day,&#8221; said one, with a hint
of hero-worship in his voice. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep the winner
i&#8217; our own country yet,&#8221; said another. The shabby-genteel
man&#8217;s assumption that his bets were in danger
had been in itself a tribute to his skill. Sympathy was a
spur to Gaunt always, and he felt that the crowd was with
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve to win, Reuben! Make no mistake o&#8217; that,&#8221;
murmured Peggy from behind. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have &#8217;ticed
ye to run at all, if I hadn&#8217;t been sure o&#8217; your winning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and looked her in the eyes. &#8220;I begin to
fancy I shall, Peggy,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but &#8217;tis long odds to
put me up at a minute&#8217;s notice against Bownas of Shap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready, are ye?&#8221; cried the starter. &#8220;Ready?
Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no excitement at the beginning of the race;
and this, too, was in keeping with the dales-folk, who
liked their pleasures to be long drawn out. It was only
the raw youngsters who showed signs of their paces along
the dusty line of road; Gaunt and Bownas trotted quietly
at the rear, remembering that a good deal of ground had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
to slip under their feet before the last swift struggle
home.</p>

<p>The haze had lifted now, and the sunlight lay so keen
on moor and pasture that those on the bridge, the remotest
point of vantage, could see each figure as it climbed the
pastures, could follow the men when they gained the
darker background of the moor.</p>

<p>Not one of the nine was running now, and three at
least were creeping painfully up the breast of the moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt&#8217;s at his old game,&#8221; said one of the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, he takes it straight as it comes. Sakes, how he
sticks to his business!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not then that eagerness began to show itself
among the onlookers. Much depended on the down-hill
scamper, but more on that stubborn climb up the hill-face
which, from below and in the sun-glare, showed
steep as a house-wall.</p>

<p>Bownas of Shap was playing his old game, too. They
could see him turning warily along the dingles, instead
of facing the high bluffs. He counted on saving wind
and gaining speed, as he had done in other struggles of
the kind; but he had not run against Reuben Gaunt
before.</p>

<p>The onlookers&mdash;and every face now was turned to the
moor with fine expectancy&mdash;could see Gaunt keeping
a straight line for the summit, though now and then he
seemed to be pulling himself forward by sheer grip of
the tough heather that hindered his feet no less than
did the steepness of the moor.</p>

<p>They were lost for awhile, Bownas and Gaunt, in the
shadow of the highest ridge. At the ridge-top, pencilled
clear against the hard blue of the sky, stood the turning-post
and the man who guarded it. Then, out of the
shadowed space, Gaunt&#8217;s figure showed; he had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
straight as a gunshot, and, without turn or halt, had
reached the flag.</p>

<p>Peggy could not rest quiet in the road below. She had
climbed to the brink of the moor by now, and three or
four of the crowd had followed her. It was Peggy&#8217;s day,
and she wished it to be full. Gaunt might be this and
that, she told herself, her eyes fixed on the moor above;
but she would forgive him fickleness and all if she could
dance on the green to-night, and know that he was the
winner of the race.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt climbs like a wildcat,&#8221; said a tough, old yeoman,
standing at Peggy&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Climbs like a man,&#8221; answered Peggy, and kept her
eyes on the hill-top.</p>

<p>Bownas had reached the flag by now, and had turned
to follow Gaunt down the moor. From below, Peggy o&#8217;
Mathewson&#8217;s could hear the eager uproar of the crowd.
None thought of the seven stragglers who followed; it
was a race between the homelander and the &#8220;foreigner,&#8221;
and Gaunt himself, though the blood was surging in
his ears, could hear a stifled echo of the roar that meant
good-will to him.</p>

<p>Gaunt had been used to say that he won his races
because his wind was a special gift, in token that his legs
were short. He needed the gift now; for, out of practice
as he was, the straight, unswerving climb had punished
him.</p>

<p>Bownas was still following his bent, down-hill as up-hill.
He chose the gentler slopes, while Gaunt ran helter-skelter
down, straight for the wall that guarded the
pastures from the moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wildcat&#8217;s won!&#8221; shouted the old yeoman at
Peggy&#8217;s ear. &#8220;He&#8217;s a furlong forrarder, and all easy-going
now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>A long, brown line of shale lay in Gaunt&#8217;s path. He
would not turn aside, but trusted to his old trick of sliding
down it, feet foremost, with the shingle scattering round
his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, be durned!&#8221; muttered the yeoman. &#8220;&#8217;Tis all
over wi&#8217; Gaunt! Just when he had the race i&#8217; his hands,
an&#8217; all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy&#8217;s face was white; for she had seen the runner
trip against a stone which did not yield to his foot, as the
shale had done. So great was Gaunt&#8217;s speed that he
could not think of checking himself; head over heels he
went, and landed on his feet again as if by a miracle.
For a second or two he stood dazed by the shock, and
Bownas got to within fifty yards of him. Then, shaking
himself together and setting his face as hard as a flint,
Gaunt started down the moor again.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll break his neck one day at yond job,&#8221; said the
yeoman to Peggy. &#8220;Glad he hasn&#8217;t done as much to-day.
Want to see him win, I.&#8221;</p>

<p>The runners were scaling the wall between moor and
pasture now, and Gaunt was a trifle the quicker in getting
over. He passed so close to Peggy that she could have
touched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run!&#8221; she panted. &#8220;Reuben, you have it! You
have it, lad!&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her, and so did Bownas o&#8217; Shap; and both
men raced forward with a quickened sense of rivalry.</p>

<p>It was now that the crowd lost all restraint, save just
as was needed to keep a clear path to the inn. From the
bridge, and from the green, and from the inn-front&mdash;where
men were standing on tiptoe in the gigs to get a
clearer view&mdash;a deafening clamour rose. It was no
spasmodic cheering, broken by silences, but a steady,
ever-growing roar, like the thunder of a stream when snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
is loosened from the hills. Never since this yearly battle
of the fells first took its place in Linsall&#8217;s story had such
a race been watched. The time between out and home
was shorter by five minutes than the fastest record
known; but, more than this, there were two men left
to fight it out to the end&mdash;two men who came with swift,
loping strides through the dust of the roadway&mdash;two
men whose faces at another time would have been terrible
to see, so contorted were they with weariness, and desperation,
and fierce effort to keep up.</p>

<p>Bownas led by a few feet now, and the onlookers were
making frenzied calls to Gaunt to make a last spurt for
it. The uproar rose to the hills that hemmed in Linsall
village, and it broke against the fells with muffled echo.
It was a moment when a man might well prove stronger
than himself, and a strange gaiety caught Reuben unawares.
There were still two hundred yards to go, and
he saw that Bownas was content to keep his lead and was
waiting for his last big effort until nearer home. Gaunt
could not wait; he gathered all his strength, and glanced
past Bownas with sudden speed and crossed the winning-line
with an impetus he could not check. The inn doorway
was in front of him&mdash;otherwise he would have
crashed against the wall in his blind rush&mdash;and he ran
down the long passage, and checked himself when he
reached the settle at the far end, and sat with his head
between his hands. A darkness and great sickness
closed about him for awhile; then he lifted his head, and
saw the landlord standing near him with an air of much
good-will and some anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me something&mdash;something in a mug, Jonas,&#8221;
said Gaunt, with a feeble smile.</p>

<p>Jonas laughed, as he patted the other on the back.
&#8220;Not just sure whether ye&#8217;ve any inward parts left at all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Mr. Gaunt? Want to cure that durned, queer feel of
emptiness? Oh, bless ye, I know it. I&#8217;ve run i&#8217; fell-races
before, but niver as ye ran to-day! God bless me,
ye&#8217;ve the legs of a deer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy had seen from the pasture-fields how Gaunt
came home far down below; and, when she reached the
village, it was to find the hero of the year being carried
shoulder-height by six of the Linsall men. No leader
of old, returning from victory through a crowded capital,
could have claimed more honour than Reuben Gaunt.
Unprepared, to gratify a lass&#8217;s whim, he had won a contest
that would go down in Garth&#8217;s history so long as
there were folk to sit beside the hearth o&#8217; nights and tell
of it.</p>

<p>Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s had had her wish. A buoyancy,
an exultation like Gaunt&#8217;s own as he covered those last
ten score yards, possessed her. It was the woman&#8217;s
pride, unalterable through changing generations, that
&#8220;her man&#8221; had won his battle.</p>

<p>When the evening came, and the sun dropped low over
Linsall Moor, and the moon climbed big and round over
the shoulder of Harts Fell, the green was full of couples
dancing to the tunes of three fiddlers perched on Mother
Lambert&#8217;s empty counter. And Peggy, though the men
pressed round her like a swarm of bees, would dance with
few but Gaunt.</p>

<p>The scene was fairy-like in its remoteness from the
humdrum round of work. The fells on the one side were
white and magical; the moor on the other showed a dark
jagged line of mystery; and between moor and fell,
Linsall village lay steeped in fleecy moonlight, her bridge
a slender arch of gossamer that spanned a stream of
pearl and blue. There was no sound, save the gentle
thud of feet on the grass, the squeak of the fiddles, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
low tranquil laugh of some country lass as she heard what
her lover stooped to tell her in the pauses of the dance.</p>

<p>When Gaunt and Peggy left the green at last, and struck
up the pastures toward home, they were followed by much
nodding of heads and wagging of tongues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt&#8217;s not content wi&#8217; winning the race, &#8217;twould
seem,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said another, &#8220;he seems like as he&#8217;s set on
winning Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s as well. There&#8217;ll be lile
trouble i&#8217; that, if the look in her face be aught to go by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy and her man moved steadily up the field-track,
then more quietly when they reached the heath.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas here you ran so well,&#8221; said Peggy, her eyes
shining with some great, unreasoning happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas because you asked it,&#8221; answered Gaunt,
slipping her arm through his own as they turned to look
down on moonlit Linsall. The faint screech of fiddles
reached them, reedy as the breeze that blew fitfully about
the heather-stems. She was silent, and Gaunt felt that
she was trembling. &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s amiss? Surely
you&#8217;re not cold on such a night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is naught, Reuben! I&#8217;ve had my day&mdash;as full
a one as ever I could wish for&mdash;and I&#8217;m frightened, somehow,
to go back, and begin to churn, and bake, and wash,
and tend the fowls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can ease you of all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were soft, and full of the tenderness which life
had tried its best to kill. She seemed about to speak,
but checked herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you listen, Peggy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we must hurry, Reuben. Come away over the
moor; there&#8217;s mother wondering all this while whatever
can have come to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not understand her mood, did not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the withdrawal which was at once proud and full of mute
appeal. They crossed the moor in a silence broken only
by the scuffle of a sheep as they awakened it in passing,
by the sudden whirr of a cock grouse as he rose from the
ling and went barking <i>to-bac, to-bac, to-bac</i> across the
moor.</p>

<p>It was Peggy who broke the silence. They had reached
the deep glen above Ghyll Farm, and she paused at the
rowan-tree which branched across the dancing stream.
She had spent long hours under shadow of the rowan
before and after she had learned her love for Gaunt; the
place was friendly to her, for it was haunted by familiar
years.</p>

<p>She stood straight in the moonlight, facing him. The
rowan-leaves threw feathery shadows on her face. &#8220;Reuben,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;what&#8217;s amiss with us both?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, naught, lile lass. You want to be free of the
churning and the rest? Well, there&#8217;s Marshlands waiting
for ye, if you choose to come as mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not tell whether sorrow or keen gladness lay
underneath the cry. He knew Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s
had never moved him as she did to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben, I&#8217;m all lost on the moor,&#8221; she went on
quickly. &#8220;I love the peat that ye tread on, and yet I
doubt ye. I&#8217;ve seen ye a man to-day, Reuben, and yet
I&#8217;m wondering whether it can last. The mood&#8217;s on ye
to make me mistress yonder. Ay, but to-morrow? Love
goes and comes wi&#8217; some folk, but it stays wi&#8217; women
such as me&mdash;make no doubt o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will stay with me. Are ye going with the rest o&#8217;
the flock, lile one&mdash;bleating me down, when I try to get
my feet on a straight road?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s stood silent. The moonlight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
dappled by the swaying rowan-leaves, showed a beauty
that was scarcely of this world. Like the weather-stained
mother who waited for her coming, down yonder at the
farm, Peggy had peeped into a bigger life than this.</p>

<p>Suddenly she lost her straightness, and was sobbing
in Gaunt&#8217;s arms. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be good to me, Reuben?
&#8217;Tis all or naught wi&#8217; me, and you can break my heart,
or mend it, just as you please. Oh, I should take shame
to talk to ye like this&mdash;but I&#8217;ll come to Marshlands wi&#8217;
no half-love fro&#8217; ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt felt a new warmth, a generous impulse, not only
to take this passionate, headstrong lass to Marshlands,
but to make her happy there. He told her as much in
few words, and the answer touch of her hands as he held
them roused something manlier, more robust, in the man&#8217;s
contrary nature.</p>

<p>They stayed awhile under the rowan, and Peggy
touched its smooth trunk from time to time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to-day,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;just happy,
Reuben. And I&#8217;m touching rowan-wood while I say
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a light in the kitchen of Ghyll Farm when
they came across the croft, and at the porch-door they
could see Widow Mathewson, her gaunt figure softened
by the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;So ye&#8217;ve been wi&#8217; Gaunt? I guessed as mich,&#8221; was
the mother&#8217;s greeting. There was little complaint in
her tone, but her usual half-sad, half-bitter acceptance
of the day&#8217;s troubles as they came.</p>

<p>Peggy was not contrite. &#8220;I&#8217;d finished the baking,
mother, and I knew ye&#8217;d guess I was off to Linsall Fair.
Mother, I never had such a day&mdash;and Reuben won the
fell-race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, he would. Give him a bit o&#8217; straight running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
for foolishness&#8217; sake, an&#8217; he&#8217;s clever; &#8217;tis when ye want
him to do summat wi&#8217; sense at th&#8217; back on&#8217;t that Gaunt
fails ye&mdash;fails ye ivery time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to ask me indoors for once,&#8221; put in Reuben.</p>

<p>The widow looked at him curiously. Without emotion,
as if she were counting up her egg money and finding
the total right, she realized that there was a change for
the better in him. His tone was grave, and he had lost
his light, come-and-go air altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;As ye please,&#8221; she answered, stepping aside to let
him pass. &#8220;&#8217;Tis so late now for us early-to-bed folk
that a bit later willun&#8217;t signify.&#8221;</p>

<p>In grim silence she brought cake and elderberry wine
from the corner cupboard and set them on the table.
Whether a guest was a welcome one or no, he must not
leave without a show of hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just help yourself, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; she said, with a certain
stateliness that was no way out of keeping with her rough
gown and weather-stained, tired face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by and by,&#8221; he said. Peggy and he were standing
on either side the hearth, and Widow Mathewson saw
the confident, warm glances that passed between them.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve something to tell you, Mrs. Mathewson. Peggy
was pleased with my running, maybe&mdash;or perhaps she
saw I was fondish of her&mdash;anyway, she has promised
to come down to Marshlands as mistress there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathewson began to stride up and down the
floor. It was her way&mdash;the man&#8217;s way&mdash;when deeply
moved. Folly, disaster, she had looked for whenever
Gaunt had crossed their path; she was not prepared for
honesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;See ye,&#8221; she cried fiercely, turning to meet Gaunt&#8217;s
eyes, &#8220;are ye meaning this? I tell ye, we&#8217;re proud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
bitter-proud, up here at Ghyll. I&#8217;ve no man to look
after Peggy&mdash;th&#8217; one I lost would have been littlish use
even if he&#8217;d lived&mdash;but I was not built after a gentle
pattern, Reuben Gaunt. If ye&#8217;re planning some fresh
bit o&#8217; devilry, I&#8217;ll bid ye keep clear o&#8217; my hands. They&#8217;re
strong hands&mdash;when I care to use &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben was at his ease for once in the widow&#8217;s presence.
This new sense of honesty was a gentler, and yet
a stronger feeling than he had known since childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis this way,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;We happen to
want one another, and we&#8217;re bent on getting one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ye&#8217;re bent on it,&#8221; said the widow drily, not taking
her eyes from Reuben&#8217;s face. &#8220;You&#8217;re bent on it to-night.
The full moon glamours folk, so they say. Will
ye be bent on it to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you&#8217;re hard on Reuben!&#8221; broke in Peggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harder than he&#8217;s been on me, these years and
years past. Are ye playing wi&#8217; my lass, or are ye not?
She&#8217;s all I have, mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt would take no offence. His spirits were high,
and that curious sense of well-doing was with him still.
&#8220;I shall be getting things to rights at Marshlands to-morrow.
A house that has had no mistress all these years
will need setting straight. After that, Peggy has only
to choose the day when she&#8217;ll come to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow&#8217;s face softened a little, but she did not spare
him. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said, her fine, keen eyes reading
every line of his face. &#8220;Ay, very well indeed, Reuben
Gaunt, if ye can hold to th&#8217; same mind two days running.
When I see Peggy wedded I shall believe &#8217;at Peggy&#8217;s
wedded. Good night to ye. I&#8217;m fair clemmed wi&#8217; all
th&#8217; day&#8217;s work, while ye two were gadding ower to Linsall
Fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy went with Gaunt to the gate of the croft. &#8220;Ne&#8217;er<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
heed mother,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;&#8217;Tis her way, Reuben.
She&#8217;ll soften to ye by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heed naught, lass, so long as ye&#8217;re lying lile and soft
i&#8217; my two arms. What a fool I&#8217;ve been all these years&mdash;what
a fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was swept away by his passion, by the girl&#8217;s free,
reckless beauty and reckless tenderness. He pictured
her down yonder in the lonely house at Marshlands.
The liberty he had cherished&mdash;liberty to come and go as
he listed, like the wind&mdash;was shorn of all attraction.
There would be warmth and well-doing about his house,
and ties to keep him safe from wandering.</p>

<p>They stood looking down the moor. The moon outlined
each smooth ridge; her light was nestled in the
misty vagueness of the hollows; away and away to the
grey-blue of the silent sky she touched the land with
witchery. And Peggy sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, lass, you&#8217;re shivering,&#8221; said Gaunt, roused
from his dreams of what might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a goose walked over my grave,&#8221; she answered
lightly. &#8220;A silly goose, Reuben, to choose just to-day
for wandering.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not tell him that she feared the day&#8217;s happiness,
feared lest all should be changed when she woke
on the morrow. Hardship was more easy to believe in,
after all, and in her experience it followed pleasure always.</p>

<p>They watched the moor; and the tenderness, the mute,
uncomplaining sorrow of the land, came close to Peggy,
as to one who had known the heath from childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;if only ye had one mind in
a day, instead of fifty&mdash;or if only I could care for ye
less&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Best care for me more instead of less,&#8221; laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
Reuben. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no heed, myself, for geese walking over a
grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was silly, I own. There, ye&#8217;ve had kisses enough
and to last&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;maybe&mdash;if ye come not too early, while
I&#8217;m milking the cows&mdash;or not overlate, when the house
will need looking to, after all the work I&#8217;ve given mother
to-day. There, Reuben&mdash;oh, there and there, if ye
must better one good kiss. Good night, Reuben.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt swung down the moor. The moon stood silver-gold
in the middle of the blue sky. A sheep got up
beneath his feet. He startled a grouse from its bed among
the heather. Far down below him he could see a light
set like a little star above the porch of Marshlands.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re used to late home-comings o&#8217; nights,&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be fewer such when Peggy comes
to Marshlands.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHATEVER doubt Widow Mathewson might have
of Gaunt&#8217;s constancy, he himself felt none. On the
morning after Linsall Fair he summoned his housekeeper,
told her that Marshlands was to have a mistress at last,
and gave orders that the disused parlour, full of faded
hangings and rusty furniture unrenewed since his mother
came here as a bride, should be turned out in readiness
for the purchases he meant to make this week in Shepston.
The best bedroom, disused, too, was to be treated
in like fashion. Now that his mind had found an anchorage,
Reuben was eager, businesslike, impatient of
delays.</p>

<p>His housekeeper said little; but she smiled often when
his back was turned, and shook her head with the foreboding
that was her only luxury.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s like a lad going off to buy a gun, or a rod, or
some such make o&#8217; toy,&#8221; was her thought &#8220;Oh, ay,
he&#8217;s keen-set on t&#8217; notion, but it winnun&#8217;t last no more
than a week. Niver met a man to tire as soon as the
master.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt did not tire, however. He was to and fro between
Ghyll Farm and Marshlands every other day,
and in between was journeying to Shepston, with Peggy
beside him in the smart, high-wheeled gig which was
known by sight to all the dales-folk.</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson said little these days, save to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
grumble that Peggy left her three parts of the work to do;
but at last she was losing her distrust of Gaunt. His
gaiety appealed to her, for she had known little of it
in her time; his forgetfulness of all past differences between
them was generous, though she only half admitted
it; above all, her headstrong lass showed likely to settle
down at last with a decent roof above her and the right
to show that pride which was ingrained in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s as well as another man,&#8221; she would
mutter, as she nursed her pipe by the hearth and waited
for Peggy to return, &#8220;though that&#8217;s saying little enough.
Come to think on&#8217;t there&#8217;s so few worth choosing that
a lass is a&#8217;most bound to make a lile fool of herseln when
it comes to marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were to be married at the end of two months.
That was the utmost Mrs. Mathewson would grant when
Reuben pressed for an earlier day.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your fancy lasts for two months, it&#8217;ll maybe last
longer,&#8221; she said drily, in answer to Gaunt&#8217;s pleading.
&#8220;My lass shall be thrown at no man&#8217;s head, Reuben,
least of all at yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Peggy the waiting-time seemed short. Her child&#8217;s
dreams up among the winding peat-ways of the moor,
her woman&#8217;s yielding to the glamour of this first and
last romance which Gaunt embodied, were of the same
fibre.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was a week after Linsall Fair&mdash;he did
not take her with him to Shepston. He had a fancy
to buy a chestnut mare he knew of, and keep it as a wedding-gift
for her, letting her find it unexpectedly in the stable
when he brought her home to Marshlands. She could
ride bareback already; he would teach her afterwards to
sit a side-saddle.</p>

<p>Between Garth and Shepston he came face to face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
with Cilla round a bend of the dusty road, and pulled his
horse up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard the news?&#8221; he asked, feeling oddly
ill at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear so little. It is not father&#8217;s way nor mine.&#8221;
Cilla&#8217;s glance rested quietly on him, and she stood a little
straighter than her wont, with an air of withdrawal.
&#8220;If &#8217;tis the fever you mean, of course we&#8217;ve heard of it.
They talk of nothing else these days in Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not the fever I meant. Do you remember that
you asked me months ago to do something? We were
standing at the porch-door at Good Intent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla flushed, and moved a pace or two away. &#8220;Yes,
I remember. It was you, Mr. Gaunt who seemed to
have forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re to be married in October,&#8221; he said bluntly.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated, then held out her hand.
&#8220;I wish you well&mdash;indeed, I wish you both well. Though
we hear so little gossip, they told me Peggy was queen
o&#8217; the fair at Linsall. She deserved to be, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smile and a bend of the head in token of farewell,
she had left him. He turned in the saddle to watch
her go down the road, with her light, easy step, then
plucked his horse into a trot. He was out of temper
with the day, though he had begun it light-heartedly
enough. His old infirmity had returned to him at sight
of Priscilla; with the best will in the world to be loyal,
he was bewildered by the grace and fragrance which Cilla
had brought along this dusty road. His vanity was hurt,
moreover; there had been no sign of regret or sorrow in
Cilla&#8217;s voice; her friendliness and her unconcern were
harder to bear than any of Widow Mathewson&#8217;s downright
attacks had been.</p>

<p>Priscilla moved more slowly once she was out of sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
She was lingering in fancy through that day of spring
when she and Gaunt had gone to Keta&#8217;s Well. And she
laughed at herself because the tears in her eyes were very
near falling. Why should she grieve because he had done
what she asked of him? Since Keta&#8217;s Well and all the
folly of the spring there had been the merciless heat, the
ruined hay-crop, the fever that had not entered Garth
as yet, though the shadow of it lay constantly about the
village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, there&#8217;s enough that is real to be thought
of,&#8221; was Cilla&#8217;s way of meeting the fresh heartache.
&#8220;Father would tell me, I&#8217;m sure, that &#8217;tis no time at all
to be playing with dreams and fancies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy the Fool stood at the forge door as she passed&mdash;Billy,
with the air of great business and importance which
had come to him since David left him in sole charge of
the forge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, Miss Good Intent!&#8221; he said, saluting
gravely. &#8220;Terrible days for pleasuring, now that David&#8217;s
left me master-smith.&#8221; He nodded toward the inside
of the smithy, and a tranquil grin broke across his face.
&#8220;Dan Foster&#8217;s lad is blowing bellows in yonder. Te-he!
I just told him to get the fire all a-glowing an&#8217; a-crackling,
an&#8217; the lile chap&#8217;s doing on&#8217;t! &#8217;Tis wonderful how some
folk do sweat while others go playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what will you play at to-day?&#8221; asked Cilla,
her smile made up of rue and rosemary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s two score iron palings waiting to be
hammered into shape, like, and Fool Billy reckons he&#8217;ll
make a start at yond same, he will. Niver knew before
what &#8217;twas to have all this wonderful lot of play to get
through with. David will laugh when he comes back.
He always did say I was a queerish terrible chap when I
settled to my play.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Priscilla was apt to search deeper into life since the
troubled days arrived. She looked now at Billy, and
remembered the scene last April at time of rescuing the
lambs; she recalled the struggle at the edge of the pool,
and Widow Mathewson&#8217;s tale of what had happened long
ago at Marshlands; she sought in Billy&#8217;s face, as older
folk had done, for some answer to the riddle of his character.
She found no answer. Unhurried, skilled at his
work so long as a comrade named it play, his blue, trusting
eyes looked into hers, and, if they held a secret, kept
it well.</p>

<p>He looked again to see if Dan Foster&#8217;s lad were plying
the bellows within doors; then, by force of habit, he drew
out a blackened pipe, and as quietly replaced it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There now!&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;What wi&#8217; all this
play about, I forgot my manners. Fancied ye had a fill
o&#8217; baccy on ye, and maybe a match to go wi&#8217; that same
baccy. Te-he, but Billy&#8217;s a fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so big i&#8217; that way as he looks,&#8221; came a voice
that went roaming down Garth street like pleasant thunder.
&#8220;What, ye&#8217;re keeping Billy from his playtime?
Shame on ye, Cilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, she&#8217;s not keeping me,&#8221; said Billy, taking Hirst&#8217;s
open pouch. &#8220;Dan Foster&#8217;s lad is doing all the work
these days, ye understand, and &#8217;twould make your sides
split to see him working at th&#8217; old bellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not all as lucky as you,&#8221; said the yeoman, as
he handed a match to Billy. &#8220;Most of us have no play&mdash;and,
by that token, I&#8217;m bringing a horse to be shod
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy lit his pipe, and drew quiet puffs before he answered.
&#8220;Well now, Mr. Hirst, I&#8217;m right set on shoeing
a horse to-morrow. After I&#8217;ve done wi&#8217; yond iron palings,
and after I&#8217;ve slept for a night in green-field&#8217;s bed, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
body might say, I&#8217;ll be ready for ye. &#8217;Tis rare fun shoeing
a lile horse, wi&#8217; a daft lad doing all the bellows&#8217; work
for ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst passed on with a cheery laugh, and linked his
arm in Cilla&#8217;s as they went up to Good Intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy is like good pasture-land,&#8221; he said, with a backward
glance at the forge. &#8220;Soft on the crust, and firm
underneath. Oh, ay, David did well to leave Fool Billy
in his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cilla did not answer. Her thoughts were half
with David, who had left Garth when she needed him,
and half with Reuben Gaunt, who hoped to keep a promise
made to her.</p>

<p>Reuben himself drove to Shepston; and he tried to get
rid of the wish that Cilla had not crossed his path to-day&mdash;Cilla,
with her witchcraft of dainty thoughts and comely
living&mdash;Cilla, whose gift in life was to make folk see
glamour in unexpected corners.</p>

<p>Shepston was busy when he reached the town. He
stabled his horse at the Norton Cross tavern, and walked
down the High Street in search of the mare he meant to
get for Peggy. Half down the street he heard himself
hailed by name, and turned. He saw Mother Lambert&#8217;s
weather-beaten face, standing behind her stall as she had
stood on the green at Linsall Fair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning,&#8221; said Gaunt, with the heedless nod of old
acquaintance.</p>

<p>He was passing on, but she checked him. &#8220;I saw ye
last at Linsall, Mr. Gaunt. D&#8217;ye mind the pedlar there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes.&#8221; He was impatient and anxious to move
forward. &#8220;I bought a fairing from him, and his face,
I fancied, was more fiery with drink than usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Lambert looked gravely at him across the
trumpery wares that covered her stall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;Best speak no ill o&#8217; the dead, sir. The pedlar&#8217;s
dead&mdash;dead o&#8217; the fever three days ago. It was fever
that mottled his face, an&#8217; he said to me as he stood on the
green after ye&#8217;d bought your fairing for Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s&mdash;he
owned, he did, that he couldn&#8217;t feel just
hisseln, like, though he meant to plod on and be
merry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt&#8217;s face was white. He had no thought of Cilla
now, but remembered only the lass who had watched him
win a race, the lass who had been tender to his failings
and buoyant in her love for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you speaking truth?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes. I mostly do, save when I&#8217;ve wares to sell;
and business, Mr. Gaunt, is another basket of eggs, as
the saying goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve laughed at the fever-dread till now,&#8221; he said,
after a troubled silence. &#8220;For myself, I take chances of
that sort of thing as they come; but &#8217;tis different when
there&#8217;s a doubt that Peggy may have caught it. Surely
you&#8217;ve to come closer to it, and stay longer with it, than
we did that day at Linsall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, for harm to come on&#8217;t? Nay! I&#8217;ve seen
plenty o&#8217; fever i&#8217; my time, an&#8217; I tell ye that kerchief ye
bought for Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s was enough in itself
to gi&#8217;e it to her. Poor Peggy! They allus said&mdash;those
&#8217;at were jealous&mdash;that her liking for bright colours
would bring her to grief one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Lambert nodded sagely after Gaunt had left
her. She had lived a hard, roving life, had long since
learned to look at her neighbours with eyes unclouded
by overmuch feeling; and she told herself now, with a
quiet, impersonal wonder, that there was a real change
in the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did ye see Reuben Gaunt go down street just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
now?&#8221; she asked a crony, who came from a neighbouring
stall for gossip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay. Straight-set-up, as usual, and a bonnie lile figure
to catch a lass&#8217;s fancy. There&#8217;s never much change in
Gaunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, there is a change, and that&#8217;s th&#8217; odd part
on&#8217;t. He&#8217;s learned to think for another first, &#8217;stead of
himself, and that means a deal. Eh, but men are bothersome
cattle! Ye think ye know &#8217;em, right to th&#8217; back o&#8217;
their minds, an&#8217; all of a sudden they turn just contrary-like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt bought the mare for Peggy, and gave orders that
it should be sent that day to Marshlands; but he had
little heart either in the bargaining or the purchase. As he
walked up the High Street toward the inn again, a hearse
was moving slowly to the churchyard which fronted and
looked down upon the road. They told him that only
one day of the last fifteen had passed without a burial,
and some days there had been three or four. It was
brought home to him at last that the Black Fever was no
boggart invented by mothers to frighten wayward bairns;
he saw the scourge now as it really was, as a pestilence
unlike all others, save the plague which many hundred
years ago, folk said, had destroyed whole villages, and had
made thriving townships into wasted hamlets.</p>

<p>Indeed, the fever, in a less degree, had that power to
weaken men by terror which the plague had had long since.
It was market-day, and a busy day, along the High Street;
but uneasiness and gloom showed plainly on all but the
most reckless faces, and farmer-men, ashamed of a weakness
they could not control, would glance at farmer-men,
seeking for the telltale patches of mulberry-red which
spelled infection.</p>

<p>Gaunt opened his lungs to the breeze when he was clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
of Shepston. He knew that there was danger to himself,
but had dismissed the thought; his cowardice was all for
Peggy. He was glad to be out among clean fields again,
with the open road in front of him, and none to talk of the
fever.</p>

<p>He walked straight up to Ghyll Farm after reaching
home, and Peggy was standing at the gate of the croft,
looking down the moor. She half looked for him, and
for that reason had fastened the crimson handkerchief
round her throat; she had tied and untied it before her
cracked mirror, with the honest coquetry which a woman
finds when she knows that one man only has a claim on it.</p>

<p>Reuben saw the scarf, as soon almost as he caught sight
of the waiting figure. The sunlight, stark and dry as the
fields it had scorched, caught the warm colour of the
kerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look tired, Reuben,&#8221; said Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s,
after a quiet glance at his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; he answered carelessly. &#8220;It was a hot
drive into Shepston, and the fools would talk of nothing
but their fever. I begin to think they&#8217;re proud of it,
Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got used to it, you see,&#8221; said the girl, with
something of her mother&#8217;s tart knowledge of the world.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis queer, Reuben, how soon ye get used to a thing,
even if &#8217;tis bad, and seem to miss it when it goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He scarcely heard her. His eyes were fixed on the
crimson scarf, and she smiled happily as she followed his
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m wearing your gift, lad. Mother chided me
just now&mdash;said &#8217;twas no sort o&#8217; fancy-stuff to wear, when
there were cattle needed milking by and by. I said
you&#8217;d given it me at Linsall Fair and the lile, soft beasts
would milk no worse because I wore it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>Gaunt, though he did not know it, had caught something
of the panic that troubled all the folk of Shepston.
&#8220;At the back of his mind,&#8221; as he put it to himself, he
was sure that Peggy would catch no harm from the scarf
at this late day; the harm was done already, or not done;
yet he could not rest so long as she was wearing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want that kerchief you&#8217;re wearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s laughed, though her eyes were
full of disquiet. &#8220;Best buy another, Reuben, if you&#8217;re
fooling me again. I&#8217;ll not let this one go to some lile
fool who&#8217;s turned her blue eyes on ye and made geese
seem swans.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then he told her&mdash;the sun lay low down to Windover
Crag by this time&mdash;that Pedlar Joe had the fever
on him when he sold the kerchief; and again she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all, Reuben? I thought &#8217;twas worse.&#8221; She
looked down the moor, and into his face again; and her
voice was soft with trouble. &#8220;Reuben, &#8217;tis ill when ye
doubt the man ye care for. I never cared, save for you;
but you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt forgot the scarf, forgot the sickness and the
hearse and the great distrust that had peopled the High
Street at Shepston.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What is amiss, then, if we&#8217;re
both of the same mind? Peggy, I&#8217;ve been fearing for you
all the way home from market; I ought to take shame that
a parcel of Shepston folk can scare me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down below in Garth, Billy had done with his day&#8217;s
play at the forge, and had wandered out into what he
named his green-field&#8217;s bed. He made up the pastures
and out into the open moor; and here, in a little hollow
deep with heather, he lay down, turned twice or thrice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
till he had made a lair for himself, and breathed a sigh
of sheer content.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a right queer matter to be born daft-witted,&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;There&#8217;s folk sleeping in Garth yonder
at this minute &#8217;twixt four hot walls, and no breath o&#8217; air
to help them. Only Fool Billy knows, &#8217;twould seem,
what a terrible soft bed a body&#8217;s body can find right up
at the top o&#8217; the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay there on his back, and watched the stars, the
waning moon whose colour was ivory tinged with saffron,
the quiet blue of the sky. The wise folk spoke of the
moor as a lonely place, where none could sleep without
fear of the ghosts that were known to haunt it. To Billy
it was home. If grouse were lying near him in the heather,
they were friends; if the old dog-fox from Sharprise
Wood chose this track for purposes connected with his
larder, Billy was well acquainted with him; as for ghosts,
there was only one that troubled him, and this had no
dwelling among the marshes and the ling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">PEGGY&#8217;S high spirits did not forsake her as the time
for her wedding drew near. Gaunt was eager,
with a dash of haste and recklessness about the matter
that appealed to her gipsy temper.</p>

<p>She knew that poor fools down in the valley were sick
with the heat and the fever-dread; for herself, she lived
on the cooler moor, and a glance at its clean acres, a touch
of its heather-wind, were enough to banish all thought of
fever like an unclean ghost that had no place here on
the hill-tops. She did not know that a part at least of
Gaunt&#8217;s haste was due to Priscilla of the Good Intent.
Since the day when Cilla had met him on the Shepston
Road, Reuben had found the old disquiet return. Like
his father before him, he had an instinct toward a wife
who was comely of speech and manner; he needed, as
Mrs. Mathewson had said bitterly in time of April snow,
&#8220;a ladyish mistress for Marshlands.&#8221; Do as he would
these days, Gaunt saw constantly the picture of Cilla in
her lilac frock. She would fit the old house as the well-ordered
ivy which grew along its front. Her voice would
sound cool and low under the dark rafter-beams. There
would be flowers about the house again, and the spinet
would awaken to life under Cilla&#8217;s fingers.</p>

<p>Reuben was tormented by that picture, and each detail
of it grew clearer as the days went by. The man was to
be pitied, maybe, for he had the gift of fancy, and at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
it bred in him a strange irresolution. The one instinct
in him longed for an orderly home, a settled purpose in
life; the other took him to the open lands, where such as
Peggy Mathewson, and the pedlar-folk, and the poachers,
lived free from all convention. Each attracted him, and
he had not once been taught, during his heedless and ungoverned
boyhood, that it was idle to pursue two whims
at once.</p>

<p>Peggy, keen-sighted as she was, had no inkling of
Gaunt&#8217;s weakness. He was eager, lover-like, full of
plans for doing this and that about the house to make it
ready for her. Even Widow Mathewson, though she
looked for it, saw no hesitancy, no sign of withdrawal as
the weeks drew on; and, in her own wry fashion, she was
proud of Reuben, as a mother is proud of a weakling
son when he shows stray glimpses of true manhood. It
was little satisfaction to her, or none at all, that Peggy
would be mistress of the biggest farm in Garth, would be
wife to one of a yeoman breed so old that the Gaunts were
counted as a sort of gentry among their farm-neighbours.
The widow had her own pride of station, and not for a
moment would she admit that her lass &#8220;was bettering
herself&#8221; by marriage; she was simply glad that the
girl, if she must needs set her heart on Reuben, was likely
to be treated well.</p>

<p>For Peggy there was no shadow lying over these weeks.
She had prayed, in her haphazard way, that there should
be no break following the glamoured day at Linsall Fair;
and her prayer was granted. It seemed strange to her
that she had ever found hard words for Reuben. He was
strong, and tender, and considerate; he asked only for
a speedy wedding, and Peggy chided her mother because
the widow was obstinate in her resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, lass,&#8221; Mrs. Mathewson would say. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
bided long for Reuben, and &#8217;tis a lile biding-time enough
I&#8217;ve set him, surely. There&#8217;s no daughter o&#8217; mine going
to come pretty-come-quick to his call, just at the minute
he cares to whistle.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Peggy would laugh, and tell herself that she was in
no great haste for wedlock, after all. She asked for
nothing beyond the present happiness. Strong at the
churn, clear of vision, quick to see shortcomings in her
neighbours, Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s had yielded altogether
to her love for Gaunt. He had put cobwebs over
her eyes, as the Garth folk said; for she heard the fairies
sing, when at nights she went up to the beck that trickled
under the rowans, and looked down at the lights of Marshlands,
and pictured Reuben there.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the waiting-time, Gaunt rode up to
Ghyll and told them that he had to be away in the Midlands
for a week. His father, in one of the buying fits
that came on him at times, had bought property down
there, and he had to look to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be a wedding-gift for you, Peggy,&#8221; he said at
parting.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lad, I want no wedding-gifts. If ye must go,
ye must go, an&#8217; good luck to ye; but, Reuben, never talk
o&#8217; gifts. The red kerchief ye bought me at the Fair
was enough for me&mdash;that, and what ye whispered on the
home-way walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were standing at the moor&#8217;s edge, and peace was
stealing up from the hollows. After the sun&#8217;s heat and
the weariness, the dusk had laid gentle fingers on the
land. There was no limit to the heath, seen by this
magical, soft light. Sharprise, crimson and gold and
purple where the last of the sunset caught his crest,
seemed to bound it on one side; but Peggy, looking out
with practised eyes, could see further hills, and hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
beyond, each putting on its nightcap of saffron haze.
Light scents, stifled by the sun, began to creep abroad.
It was a gloaming such as few could see without a quickened
sense of the big life behind all frets and worries of
the long day&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>For Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s it was home. These
darkening hollows, the rough, winding ridges reaching
out to the spaces where, in some heathen way of worship,
she always sought her God, the cool, faint smell of the
bracken, and the ling, were all that spelled life and freedom
for Peggy. The gloaming&#8217;s quiet, Gaunt&#8217;s nearness,
softened her reckless spirits, but could not check her
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Reuben, I am daft!&#8221; she said, putting both
hands into his. &#8220;Thought I could hold my own, I, and
I&#8217;m thinking only o&#8217; ye. Will ye come back, or will ye
not&mdash;and are ye true, or are ye not&mdash;and all such
moonshine nonsense. Reuben, I&#8217;ve been happy these
last days. Ye wouldn&#8217;t spoil it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not lightly,&#8221; said Reuben, as he kissed her good-by,
and went down the moor.</p>

<p>The next day Peggy was listless and out of heart.
She fancied the heat ailed her, though until now she had
been careless of all extremes of weather. Widow Mathewson
noticed the change, as she smoked her pipe by the
hearth that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lile lass,&#8221; she said, &#8220;ye&#8217;re fretting for Reuben.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy shivered, and crept nearer the peat-fire.
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m thinking all o&#8217; ghosts, mother. He has
to be away, and the fool I am to be needing him so,
and there&#8217;s many a mile &#8217;twixt this and his home-coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow smiled, but her face was full of compassion.
&#8220;I loved your father i&#8217; that way, Peggy. He was niver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
much to lean on, but I missed him sorely when he went
down kirkyard lane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sneering at Reuben again, mother.&#8221; The
girl&#8217;s temper was frayed to-day and broken at the edges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay. I begin to think Reuben&#8217;s stauncher than
your father iver war. Happen ye&#8217;ve come to your own,
Peggy, for a man as can win a fell-race o&#8217; the Linsall sort
has summat behind it all. Ye&#8217;ll shape him by and by.
Oh, ay, ye&#8217;ll shape him. Men are all like a blunt bit o&#8217;
millstone grit; they need a chisel, they.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s crept nearer still to the peats.
The light of the one lamp shone on the pewter and the
delftware that was Ghyll&#8217;s special pride, and the fire-glow
played bo-peep in corners of the living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarce feel like a bride, mother,&#8221; said Peggy, after
a long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts!&#8221; answered Widow Mathewson. &#8220;Few maidens
do. Ye talk as if there were no modesty left i&#8217; the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so cold. All day it has been like a goose walking
ower my grave&mdash;just as I said to Reuben when we walked
fro&#8217; Linsall Fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow was easy in her mind to-night. Her hidden
liking for Gaunt need not be checked so much in future;
only she knew how bitterly she would miss Peggy in and
about the house; but she knew, too, that it was idle or
worse, to keep her lass from a home of her own. A glance
at the girl&#8217;s face, white and pinched, might have startled
Widow Mathewson; but she smoked her pipe, and looked
into the grate, and hugged her self-content as a luxury
seldom found at Ghyll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddle-me-ree,&#8221; she answered, with pleasant tartness.
&#8220;Th&#8217; only geese as are walking abroad, to my
knowledge, are ye an&#8217; Reuben&mdash;an&#8217; he&#8217;s a gander.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Oh, lass, Peggy, I&#8217;ve it all by heart! Niver sich a one i&#8217;
the world as your man; an&#8217; ye know his shortcomings plain
as your own face in a pool; an&#8217; ye throw bits o&#8217; pebble
into th&#8217; pool, just to stir his proper likeness into pleasanter
shape; an&#8217; ye call it loving the lad. Lord o&#8217; mercy,
there&#8217;s been many a woman at yond pool-edge afore your
time, and will be after. I war there myseln once. &#8217;Tis
only nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy got up and went out through the porch, and
stood looking out and away across the moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I war there myseln once,&#8221; repeated Widow Mathewson,
with a tolerant smile. &#8220;I munnot forget what &#8217;twas
like&mdash;just the wee, lile fairies dancing, an&#8217; witchcraft
ower the moor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knocked her pipe out on the grate, and youth
touched her brown, scarred face for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good sakes,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to be young
again like that&mdash;cobwebs about my eyes or no. Better
be a blithesome fool at two-and-twenty than a wiser one
at sixty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five days later Gaunt returned to Garth. He came
by the morning mail-coach, and sat by Will the Driver&#8217;s
side, and asked as many questions regarding the health
of Garth folk as if he had been absent for a year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ve &#8217;scaped fever right enough,&#8221; said Will,
trying to answer all his questions at once. &#8220;They&#8217;re a
bit scared still, but forgetting all such rubbish. Widow
Lister&#8217;s hale and hearty&mdash;ay, just a shade too hale and
hearty. Billy is laking at the forge, an&#8217; doing as much
real work as David did, an&#8217; willun&#8217;t take a penny for &#8217;t.
Has made a box, he, an&#8217; tells all folk to put their silly
money in through the slit and let it bide there till David
comes again. He has no use for money, he&mdash;lile, wise
lad as he is.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;And Widow Mathewson?&#8221; asked Gaunt.</p>

<p>Driver Will knew well enough what news the other
was seeking; it was common knowledge now that Peggy
o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s and Gaunt had been &#8220;asked&#8221; three
times at church. For that reason Will concealed his
knowledge, as if it were a crime, and affected a fine ignorance
as he flicked his team with the whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s well enough, or was a few days since.
Have not seen Peggy or th&#8217; widow since Monday last.
Terrible home-bird folk, both on &#8217;em. I liken &#8217;em always
i&#8217; my mind to a brace o&#8217; nesting grouse, so shy an&#8217; fierce
an&#8217; prideful as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt asked for no more news until the coach rounded
the curve that brought him within two miles of Garth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Miss Priscilla?&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver gave him a shrewd, hasty glance. &#8220;Oh, well
enough. She never alters&mdash;a breath o&#8217; rosemary along
the dusty road. Wish I&#8217;d been born a lile thought higher
in station, and could cast my eyes that way. There
never were two made like Miss Good Intent. And there
she is, by that token, walking just ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can put me down,&#8221; said Gaunt.</p>

<p>Driver Will wasted little time in stopping and in starting
off again. He greeted Priscilla with a friendly,
courteous salute when a moment later he passed her on
the road; and then he touched his horses&#8217; ears with a
gentle whip that spoke of deep reflection on his part. Will
had leisure for reflection during those long drives between
Shepston and the remote hamlet that ended his twenty-mile
journey, and it was second nature to him now to
piece together the life stories of those who dwelt along
the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must feel odd to be one o&#8217; Mr. Gaunt&#8217;s sort,&#8221; he
was thinking. &#8220;I mind yond day i&#8217; spring when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
drove out wi&#8217; me, sweet as kiss-me-quicks, to Keta&#8217;s
Well. I mind the way they came home again&mdash;she
with the clover-pink in her cheeks, and Gaunt with a
queer look in his eyes I&#8217;d not seen there before. Get
along, Captain, or they&#8217;ll take ye for a tramp. Gee-up!
And now he&#8217;s come home to wed Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s;
and I fancied, when he was seeking news just now, &#8217;twar
Peggy he war asking for, until&mdash;well, until he named
Miss Good Intent. Eh, well&mdash;get along, Captain!
The Queen doesn&#8217;t wait for her mails while such as ye
catch a sleep along the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt had overtaken Cilla long ago, and she had turned
to meet his greeting with the clover-pink in her cheeks
that Will the Driver had thought of.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to my wedding?&#8221; he asked, ill at
ease after his journey south, and all the brave thoughts
that had kept him company on the northward road.</p>

<p>Priscilla laughed. It was the Garth way, when trouble
must be met. &#8220;You have asked me, Reuben&mdash;and
father, too; of course we shall be at the kirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked side by side in silence until the grey gable
of Good Intent showed near at hand. Reuben could not
take his eyes from the girl&#8217;s face, and presently she looked
up, embarrassed by a feeling of shame and unrest for
which she could find no reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you both well,&#8221; she said, halting at the gate.</p>

<p>The voice was not Cilla&#8217;s; it was hesitating, cold.
A random impulse took Gaunt unawares.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla,&#8221; he began eagerly.</p>

<p>She withdrew, and her coldness disappeared. She was
self-reliant again, full of a dainty, half-mocking rebuke
that would not stoop to anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They call you running-water,
Reuben, but I&#8217;ve better hopes of you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Reuben stayed a moment, watching her, until the
house-porch hid her. For once he was troubled by the
knowledge of his own weakness. An hour ago he had
been full of his wedding plans, full of his early scamper out
to Garth by the mail. Peggy did not expect him until
late afternoon, and he had looked forward, with a boy&#8217;s
zest, to the surprise of a morning visit to Ghyll. It was
Thursday, and Peggy would be busy at the churn; he
would help her at the work; Widow Mathewson would
have her gibe, half tart, half friendly, when she put her
head round the door of the dairy and found him &#8220;doing
real work for once in a long journey.&#8221; That was the
picture he had seen&mdash;until he overtook Priscilla on the
road.</p>

<p>Gaunt set his face toward the moor and made his way
up to Ghyll; but the brightness of the picture had gone.
He blamed himself for that moment&#8217;s treason with Cilla;
it seemed an ill beginning for his wedding. The day
was hot and garish, too, and the fierce summer had set
its mark on the pastures and the hedgerows. Such leaves
as were left unshrivelled showed lifeless and drab, and
never a bird sang. Thirst was walking like a spectre
through the land, side by side with the heat. The fields
were gaping wide, entreating rain. Even the yarrow flowers
liking a lean and scanty soil, carried drooping heads. The
sheep stood staring up into the sky, for they were tired
of cropping grass that was tough and lifeless as ill-won
hay.</p>

<p>When he reached the moor, Gaunt looked for Ghyll
Farm. Its roof was set in the middle of waving lines
of heat-haze, and no life stirred about the house. Fancy
had played Reuben many a surly trick, but it helped him
now to brace himself for coming trouble. Dalliance
in sheltered Garth was forgotten; he knew that ill news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
awaited him, and went forward, preparing himself to
meet it. With all his faults, Gaunt was apt to meet an
open danger in the face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathewson, from the window of Peggy&#8217;s bedroom,
had seen him come up the moor, and ran down
and out into the croft. She found him opening the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come nigh, Reuben,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I tell you,
don&#8217;t come nigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her strong, lean arms were stretched towards him,
motioning him away; there was trouble in her face, and
her eyes had the look which tired folk wear when they
have been awake throughout the night.</p>

<p>He thought at first that her old distrust of him had
returned and laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not to be kept away from
Ghyll these days, mother. Peggy is pledged to marry me
next week, and &#8217;tis overlate for you to say no to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he came nearer Widow Mathewson withdrew.
Gaunt could make nothing of the look she gave him&mdash;tragical,
and full of pity, and weary beyond all belief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll not come in,&#8221; she said sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Reuben, Reuben, the fever&#8217;s come to Ghyll.
Peggy ligs yonder i&#8217; her bed, and her face is ill to look at.
Ye&#8217;ll catch it, too, if ye come nigh the house&mdash;for me
&#8217;tis no matter&mdash;I&#8217;m ower-old to care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt paused for a moment, shocked by the news.
Then he crossed the garden-strip, and stood beside her
in the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;it seems we&#8217;ve to know
one another better. D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m feared o&#8217; the fever,
if Peggy has caught it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood away from him. In the hour of fear she
could not rid herself of this habit of denying all courage
in a man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;Fever means little to me,&#8221; she said drily. &#8220;I&#8217;m
over and done with, Reuben, and care niver at all whether
I lig me down or no. But ye&#8217;re young, lad&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a coward,&#8221; broke in Reuben.</p>

<p>She glanced again at his face. &#8220;Well, no,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I was wrong there, and I own it. But, Reuben&mdash;there&#8217;s
one i&#8217; five lives on to tell on&#8217;t if they catch the
fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Peggy must be the one, that&#8217;s all, mother.
We&#8217;ll save her yet between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no thought of himself. His face, after he had
heard her news, was softened, yet full of quiet strength.
The widow felt a grudging admiration for this man,
with whom she had fought so bitterly in days gone by;
she looked again at his trim, healthy body, at the young
health in his face, and she was filled with pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben, lad, go back ower th&#8217; moor,&#8221; she said, peremptorily.
&#8220;If one&#8217;s to die, there&#8217;s lile use killing two.
I tell ye,&#8221; she broke off, with a touch of her old bitterness,
&#8220;the fever takes no more count o&#8217; Mr. Gaunt o&#8217; Marshlands
than it does o&#8217; plain Peggy Mathewson. &#8217;Tis
not just a risk ye&#8217;re taking; &#8217;tis as near to certain as
aught i&#8217; this life can be that ye&#8217;ll catch it, an&#8217; die on&#8217;t,
an&#8217; no more o&#8217; Gaunt o&#8217; Marshlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s not much to boast of as it is. If you
put it that way, I&#8217;m risking little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson, though she and Peggy had lived
high up above the peopled villages, had a sure instinct
for truth or meanness in her fellows. She could detect
no sign of cowardice under Gaunt&#8217;s quiet acceptance of
his destiny. There was no bluster, covering a weak
purpose. He meant to share Peggy&#8217;s trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben, there&#8217;s few i&#8217; Garth would be so daft,&#8221; she
said, still guarding the porch. &#8220;Think while! I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
known what the fever means longer than ye could know
it. Thirty year back it came to Garth, an&#8217; good men o&#8217;
their hands&mdash;good men o&#8217; their lives, too, an&#8217; honest&mdash;dared
not come nigh a house that had the white cross on
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father used to tell of it.&#8221; Reuben was indifferent,
as if it were no time to listen to bygone tales. He was
thinking of Peggy, lying helpless in the up-stairs room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he tell you that the coffiners were found missing,
when they were needed to see bodies buried decently
fro&#8217; end to end o&#8217; Garth? Did he tell ye that men who&#8217;d
faced storm on th&#8217; moor, an&#8217; danger o&#8217; most sorts, sat
shivering by their fires, an&#8217; dursn&#8217;t stir a finger to help
stricken folk? Oh, Reuben, lad, &#8217;tis no game o&#8217; kiss me by
the stream, this, and naught to bother ye after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never said it was, mother,&#8221; said Gaunt drily. &#8220;I&#8217;m
here to see we do our best for Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow understood, somehow, that Reuben the
despised was her master in this time of stress. Weak
as running water he might be afterwards, when better
days arrived; but now he had the strength of many a
likelier man. Her good man had been weak in all days,
fair or foul, and memory of him had hindered her outlook
upon Gaunt.</p>

<p>She stood in silence for awhile, her spare height framed
against the entry to this house of sickness. Far down the
reaches of the moor, a tired haze lay, and prayed for
rain; from the blue of the weary sky the sun shone fiercely.
Again the mother-pity came to Widow Mathewson. For
herself, it did not matter; she could tend Peggy, and could
die if her time had come, and no tears wasted; but Gaunt
had no need to die just yet. She guarded the grey old
porch as men, in the lawless times, had fought for their
wives and bairns at this same door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the waiting-time will trouble ye, Reuben,&#8221; she
said, in a matter of fact, quiet voice. &#8220;Th&#8217; men are
cowards when th&#8217; fever comes, for that reason. If they
could know i&#8217; a day or so whether they&#8217;d caught it or no,
they&#8217;d niver heed the danger, like. Women are used to
waiting, and they&#8217;re bolder at these times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming in, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, think ower it, lad! Think ower it! There&#8217;ll be
six weeks o&#8217; waiting afore iver ye know whether ye&#8217;ve
caught th&#8217; fever. Six weeks, Reuben! Plenty o&#8217; men
wouldn&#8217;t wait as long for a maid that was bonnie and
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben took her by the arms, and made a way for himself.
&#8220;There, mother, &#8217;tis done now, I take it. Lucky
I told them down at Marshlands that I might or might
not be home to-day. They&#8217;ll not sit up for me to-night,
and to-morrow I must get a message down somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathewson and Gaunt stood facing each other
in the living-room. If there had been enmity between
them, they did not remember it; a grave silence held
between them, for each knew that death lay very near,
not to Peggy only, but to themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still a chance to go back, Reuben,&#8221; she said
at last. &#8220;Ye may or may not have caught it by stepping
into t&#8217; house, and ye need say naught to nobody; but,
if ye once go up into th&#8217; chamber&mdash;an&#8217; I see your eyes
on th&#8217; stair-door&mdash;there&#8217;ll be no return for ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>A troubled moaning sounded from the room above, and
Gaunt laid a hand on the sneck of the staircase door.
&#8220;Maybe &#8217;twould ease the lass if she knew I was near,&#8221;
he said gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;She willun&#8217;t know, she&#8217;s ower far gone, I tell ye!
Reuben, my lad, have just a thought for yourseln.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her, with his curious, new look of gravity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and self-effacement, and went up the stair. The widow
heard his step on the boards overhead, then a startled
cry. She knew what the cry meant. The Peggy who
had watched him win the fell-race, who had danced on
Linsall Green, was not the lass who lay on the bed up
there; for the fever laid ugly hands on the faces of its
victims, and on their minds its hold was still more cruel.
There were no wild outbursts of delirium, followed by
intervals of sanity and hope; there was only the low, helpless
muttering, the sluggish apathy, the denial of all power
or will to find healing from any human ministry.</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson paced up and down the living-room
with her manlike strides; and by and by she heard Gaunt
pacing up and down the floor above. It was Gaunt&#8217;s
hour of bitterness, the first hour of his heedless life that
had found him ready to hearken to his lesson. If he had
dealt ill with Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s in times past, he was
paying something of the penalty now. It was not so
much the bodily change in her that shocked and terrified
him; it was the knowledge, brought suddenly home to
him, that she did not care whether he stood at her bedside
or not, that likely she would never care again in this
world. The incessant moaning maddened him; it
seemed to tell of an anguish that was beyond reach of his
help. He could not believe that Peggy herself felt nothing,
knew nothing&mdash;that it was he, in full vigour of mind
and body, who suffered for her, just by looking on.</p>

<p>He came down the stone stairway at last, and the widow
ceased her restless walk. She looked at his face. It
was white and stern, but there was no trace of personal
fear on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was as well I came,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;As well you came,&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;You say that
after&mdash;after going in yond up-stairs room?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;Yes, mother. You may be tough, but &#8217;twould drive
ye mad to live alone with what&#8217;s in the house here. Mother,
is there naught at all we can do to ease her?&#8221; he broke off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but not mich. I&#8217;m skilled enough i&#8217; nursing-work,
so far as that goes. But t&#8217; fever shoves a body
aside, an&#8217; willun&#8217;t let nursing have its say.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time she let weakness overcome her. Her
tears were few, but full of passionate relief; and they were
a tribute to the sense that, for once in her stormy life,
she had a man about her in time of need.</p>

<p>Gaunt patted her gently on the shoulder. All the
hidden liking between the oddly-assorted pair was patent
to them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wish Peggy up yonder
could cry like that. &#8217;Twould do her a power o&#8217; good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward gloaming of that day, as Reuben stood at the
window after one of his fruitless visits to the room above,
he saw a lad come up the slope of the moor. He ran
out across the croft, and shouted to the lad. Already he
had learned the instinct of all who had seen the fever
close&mdash;the instinct to cry, like a leper of old, that none
must come too near.</p>

<p>The lad ceased whistling, and halted in surprise;
for Reuben, though he did not know it, was waving his
arms like one far gone in drink or madness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I war nobbut stepping up for a sitting of eggs fro&#8217;
th&#8217; widow. Miss Cilla o&#8217; Good Intent telled me to
come,&#8221; he said, half blubbering. &#8220;&#8217;Twas promised,
yond clutch of eggs, an&#8217; Miss Good Intent wants t&#8217;
chickens reared i&#8217; good time for the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt saw now that it was Dan Foster&#8217;s lad, whose
delight, like that of bigger men-folk, was to run errands
for Priscilla when he was not blowing the bellows for
Fool Billy at the forge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;Bide where ye are!&#8221; he called sharply. &#8220;I want
you to go back to Marshlands, and tell them I shall not
be home for weeks. Have you got that message into
your head, Dan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said the lad, recovering from his bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then go to Good Intent, and tell Miss Cilla that
for God&#8217;s sake she is not to come nor send to Ghyll here.&#8221;
Gaunt, with a backward thought of Peggy lying in the
up-stairs room, was ashamed of his eagerness that Cilla
should be saved. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not forget, Dan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the boy, his native curiosity conquering the
last trace of fear. &#8220;No, I&#8217;ll not forget, Mr. Gaunt;
but what mun I say is t&#8217; reason, like, that Miss Good
Intent can&#8217;t get her eggs? She&#8217;s main set on getting that
clutch, she is, an&#8217; she&#8217;ll fancy it war me as disappointed
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed harshly. &#8220;The reason? Tell her that
the fever&#8217;s come to Ghyll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a wounded rabbit the lad sought cover. To him
the fever meant all that was terrible, mysterious; he had
heard his elders talk of it these months past beside the
hearth; he feared that, even at this distance and with the
clean breath of the heath between himself and Ghyll, he
might be overtaken by the pestilence. Gaunt watched
him run far down the moor, and turn the shoulder of a
hillock, and then he went indoors again. Mrs. Mathewson
was sitting by the hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent word to Marshlands,&#8221; he said, taking a seat
in the settle-corner, as if the widow and he were friends
of long standing. &#8220;They&#8217;ll not look for me till I come
home again; and meanwhile the farm and all that will be
cared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow lifted her head and looked at Gaunt with
the keen glance which, until to-day, he had found disconcerting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
No anxiety, no brooding instinct of disaster,
could check the tongue of this woman who had seen life&#8217;s
soft illusions leave her one by one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not likely to reach home again, Reuben.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely not,&#8221; he answered, feeling for his pipe and
filling it with careful fingers. &#8220;There&#8217;s few would miss
me, come to think of it, save you and Peggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d miss ye, Reuben Gaunt?&#8221; she snapped, with a
tired effort to resist her new outlook on the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you, mother. D&#8217;ye hear Peggy moaning up above
us? &#8217;Twas time that I, or another, came to help ye to
bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson reached out for her black clay
pipe, and took a bit of live peat from the fire, and lit the
half-filled bowl. &#8220;We mun as weel smoke in company,
Reuben,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They smoked in friendship for awhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt,&#8221; said the widow suddenly, &#8220;d&#8217;ye know what
fear means or what death means, or are ye a likelier lad
than I thought ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what death means, mother,&#8221; said Reuben, as
he moved from the settle-corner to stir the peat-fire into
life. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a silence fell between them. Then the widow
lit her pipe afresh, and her voice was gentler than Gaunt
had known it hitherto.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve fooled a good few women i&#8217; your time, Reuben;
but I fancy ye&#8217;re not by way o&#8217; fooling now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Gaunt, &#8220;I&#8217;m not by way of fooling now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside there was no breath of ease to hint that rain
might come to-morrow, or the next day after that. In the
red of a stagnant sunset the day had ceased, and night
brought only a sultry heat that taxed man&#8217;s endurance
to the breaking point.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; said Widow Mathewson, &#8220;I wish th&#8217; wind
would ding the house-door down, if only to stifle yond
moaning up above us. She&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got, an&#8217; I can do
naught at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bide and see, mother. All&#8217;s not over yet. There,
let me fill your pipe again for you, mother. &#8217;Twill never
do to let you go handling an empty bowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their vigil had begun. Widow Mathewson stole quiet
glances now and then at the other&#8217;s face. She was wondering
if the fever had been sent, after all, to make a man
of Gaunt of Marshlands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DAN FOSTER&#8217;S lad lost no time in delivering Gaunt&#8217;s
message at Marshlands. Fright lent speed to his
legs, and he was glad to pass on his terror to older folk,
with a boy&#8217;s faith that they would be able, in their wisdom,
to relieve him of it.</p>

<p>He got little comfort, however, from Gaunt&#8217;s housekeeper.
Her face was scared as his own, and she half-closed
the door against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis just like a trick o&#8217; yond Mathewsons,&#8221; she
snapped. &#8220;Keep themselves apart, they, and reckon
to wear a mucky sort o&#8217; pride o&#8217; their own. Contrairy
folk, I allus did say; and now they&#8217;ve brought fever into
Garth. Oh, ay, &#8217;tis like &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that she closed the door outright on Dan Foster&#8217;s
lad, just as her master had done upon the stranger-woman
long ago. She and old Gaunt suffered from terror of
different kinds, but the result in action was the same.</p>

<p>The lad whimpered afresh, just as Billy the Fool had
done in that same long ago, as he found himself lonely
in the cutting wind. Then he set off again for Good
Intent. Miss Cilla would be there; and there was healing
wherever Miss Cilla was.</p>

<p>He found her throwing corn to her pigeons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your clutch of eggs, Dan?&#8221; she asked, looking
at the empty basket on his arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>A boy who has had one rebuff fears twenty afterwards
to follow, and Dan kept his distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Gaunt wouldn&#8217;t let me come nigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dursn&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla came to the gate of the croft. &#8220;You&#8217;re no coward,
Dan. Never say &#8216;daren&#8217;t&#8217; again in my hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve fever up at Ghyll,&#8221; he said, and turned half
about, as if expecting to be driven away.</p>

<p>Priscilla lost her courage, as Dan Foster&#8217;s lad had done,
but her excuse was cowardice for another. Personal fear
she had none; and throughout the long reign of terror,
whenever her father had gone in dread of fever at times,
Cilla had never yielded to panic. She had met the danger
as she had faced the heart-sickness which Gaunt had
caused her in the spring; for Cilla&#8217;s slimness, the charm
which all acknowledged, were made up of strength, not
weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Dan&mdash;tell me quickly&mdash;is it at Ghyll
the fever is? It is not Mr. Gaunt who has it? That cannot
be, for I saw him only a few hours since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; the lad answered bluntly. &#8220;Mr. Gaunt he
hasn&#8217;t got it yet, but he&#8217;ll have it soon, I reckon. Seems
he&#8217;s helping up yonder at Ghyll. Said he wouldn&#8217;t
be home for weeks, he did, and bade me carry a message
for him to Marshlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord help us!&#8221; broke in Widow Lister&#8217;s soft, kittenish
voice. &#8220;I said &#8217;twould come, an&#8217; what&#8217;s a poor
widow-body to do if she catches it, and her living all by
her lone without chick nor child to help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow had a keen scent for disaster. She had seen
Dan come down the road with a look of fright, had followed
him, and now was standing close to Cilla&#8217;s elbow.
As of old, her first thought was for herself; that was why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
as she stood in the sunlight, no line or wrinkle showed on
her babyish face, though other women of her age would
have earned such marks of righteousness long since.</p>

<p>Cilla turned, and her smile was quick and eager. She
was glad just now for a respite from her thoughts. &#8220;Lord
help other folk, Mrs. Lister,&#8221; she answered briskly.
&#8220;Have you ever tried that medicine?&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow sighed and her eyes sought the ground
meekly. &#8220;Chit of a girl,&#8221; she was thinking, &#8220;to go lecturing
me. As if I didn&#8217;t spend all my days i&#8217; worriting
about other folks&#8217; troubles. Am always the first, I, to
find troubles out. But, then, she doesn&#8217;t know what the
fever means, the lile, daft lass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan had taken a look at the sun, his only timepiece,
and had grown alert on the sudden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will bid you good day, Miss Cilla,&#8221; he said, touching
his cap. &#8220;&#8217;Tis five of the clock, or thereabouts, an&#8217; I
promised Billy the Fool to bellows-blow for him. He gets
terrible short i&#8217; the temper, does Billy, if I&#8217;m not there
to a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Lister followed him down the road. &#8220;Oh,
Dan, my lad!&#8221; she called after him. &#8220;Tell Billy he&#8217;s
never mended my bit of a window-fastener yet. David
promised to do it, an&#8217; went overseas; then Billy said he&#8217;d
do the job; but men are all of a pattern, so &#8217;twould
seem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla watched the two of them out of sight. Well as she
knew the widow, there was something unexpected,
ludicrous almost, in her remembrance of the window-fastener.
The fever had come to Ghyll, it might steal
down to Garth before the month was out; yet Widow
Lister, in the midst of childish fright, could remember
that David had left one job undone when he set sail for
Canada.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s amiss, lile lass?&#8221; asked her father, coming
down the highway and seeing the troubled look on her
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, father. The day has been overwarm,
and I&#8217;m feeling it, maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t go blaming the weather,&#8221; roared Yeoman
Hirst, admitting all the parish into his confidence. &#8220;Weather
comes, and it goes. There needs be more than that
to shake you, Cilla.&#8221;</p>

<p>She told her news and Yeoman Hirst stood very still
for a moment. He was afraid, and he was conquering
his fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas bound to reach us soon or late,&#8221; he said, in a
steady voice. &#8220;Fancied it might leave bonnie Garth
alone, but &#8217;twas not to be. We mun just look it straight
i&#8217; the face, lass, an&#8217; get on with our day&#8217;s work as if naught
had happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla put an arm through her father&#8217;s. There was
something vastly clean, and strong, and childlike in the
yeoman&#8217;s faith; he was a man to lean upon, as Widow
Mathewson would have put it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at Ghyll, you say?&#8221; went on the farmer, after
a pause. &#8220;Which of the two has caught it&mdash;the mother,
or Peggy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan didn&#8217;t say. He was so scared, poor lad, that
he seemed glad to be rid of his message and away. But
Reuben Gaunt is there and means to bide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst&#8217;s temper was ruffled by his fear and the need to
check it, as a strong man&#8217;s way is. &#8220;Can understand
his being there&mdash;but, as for biding, Gaunt was never one
to bide two minutes i&#8217; one place, &#8217;specially if there happened
to be danger to his durned, soft body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, father.&#8221; Cilla&#8217;s voice was warm in
defence of the man who had slighted her. &#8220;He may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
this and that, but not a coward. If he&#8217;d found all well at
Ghyll, he might have roamed abroad; as it was, he
stayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the snod ways o&#8217; reasoning ye women have!&#8221;
growled Hirst. &#8220;Dan brought false news, if he said
Gaunt stayed in a fever-house. I wouldn&#8217;t do it myself,
lass, and I should reckon myself a prudent man for taking
to my heels. There, there! I never could bear to wrangle,
least of all wi&#8217; ye, Cilla. Come away in, and get my tea
ready. I&#8217;m droughty and dry, like the roads that clem ye
up wi&#8217; dust these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Ghyll, up on the lonely moor, the hot day ended in
weariness and hardship. Widow Mathewson had crept
often up the stair, to see if she could help her lass. Now
she and Reuben were smoking together beside the hearth.
If courage needed proof, these two were finding the best
gift of life&mdash;bravery won from fear. The fever was no
fanciful scourge, to be tempted by encouragement into
building foul nests about a house. It came like a sword
that did not kill with a clean blade at once, but hacked
its victims with a blunt rusty edge until the end came;
and strength or weakness of the folk who met it mattered
little, as with other plagues.</p>

<p>The widow and Reuben Gaunt smoked tranquilly by
the hearth; and the quiet, hot silence lay about two folk
who were learning to approve each other. The woman,
after the moorland fashion, was passing the time with
tales of the last visitation. It seemed to give her some
relief, just as the sleepy fire of peats served, in some odd
way, to cheer the sultriness which it intensified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye were in your cradle then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;an&#8217; knew
naught on&#8217;t, though it carried your mother off. Reuben,
if ye ever want to know what flimsy stuff we&#8217;re made of,
high and low, good &#8217;uns an&#8217; bad&mdash;ye&#8217;ve got to look on at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
a fever-time. Th&#8217; fear seems more catching than th&#8217;
fever itseln, an&#8217; always th&#8217; big, hearty men catches it
worst. Oh, the sights that come back to mind!
Thirty-and-four year ago it war, and all comes
back as plain as Peggy&#8217;s moanings up aboon us
yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt saw that it eased her to talk of olden days. The
man had grown gentle, considerate. He was full of this
new experience of thinking for others, rather than himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about them, mother,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no use i&#8217; telling. Ye need to have seen
it&mdash;as ye will do, happen, if ye&#8217;re spared&mdash;to know the
muckiness o&#8217; fright. Ivery house war a island to itseln.
Men who&#8217;d faced bulls run mad at Shepston market-day,
men who&#8217;d risked crossing the bogland at dark o&#8217;
neet, to bring comfort to a friend,&mdash;where were they,
Reuben? Hugging their own firesides. Not a drop o&#8217;
milk could the poorer sort get&mdash;and milk was needed, ye&#8217;ll
be sure, i&#8217; the stricken cottages&mdash;for a watch was kept
at th&#8217; farm-gate, an&#8217; they were fended off afore they could
bring their pitchers nigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow talked of things she had seen long ago with
clear unfrightened eyes. She would pause to light her
pipe, and then would fall into a friendly silence, taking
up the tale again at leisure. For she knew that, however
it went with Peggy, there would be time and to spare for
talk with Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard young folks shiver an&#8217; shake when small-pox
was so much as named. Bless ye, I&#8217;ve seen worse
nor small-pox. It may spoil your face&mdash;an&#8217; what day of
a hard life doesn&#8217;t help to spoil your looks?&mdash;but there&#8217;s
a chance of living on. There&#8217;s the rub, lad! &#8217;Tis when
ye set folk face to face wi&#8217; what&#8217;s all but certain death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
that ye know what they&#8217;re made of. There&#8217;s rum i&#8217; the
cupboard, Reuben. I&#8217;m forgetting what manners I iver
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and thank you, mother. Not just to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow got up and set glasses and a bottle on the
table, and took down the kettle from the crane hanging
over the peat-fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go too far wi&#8217; godliness all at once, Reuben,&#8221;
she said, with a flash of her old tartness. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re
not going to save Peggy by keeping a drop o&#8217; liquor out
o&#8217; ye, but happen ye&#8217;ll let the fever in by playing the
miser that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt had been right when he said that the widow
could never have borne her loneliness without a man
to help her. Already she was gentler than he had known
her. She jested about the measure of rum she shared with
him, saying that he led her into bad ways. She had found
that interval of peace which sometimes comes to folk in
the bitterest of their trouble; and those who have lived
long, and suffered long, say that it is God&#8217;s breathing-space,
granted to brave folk lest their courage fail them at the
pinch.</p>

<p>Down at Garth, the stars lay tranquil over David&#8217;s forge.
Dan Foster&#8217;s lad was sweating at the bellows, while Billy
the Fool played at getting the day&#8217;s work done. Billy
had finished the last of the job, when soon afterwards
Yeoman Hirst came by, and, seeing the fire-glow across
the road, stepped in to ask if his fence-rails were ready for
the morrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he!&#8221; chuckled Billy. &#8220;Said they&#8217;d be done right
fair in time, I did, and Billy keeps his word. Ye&#8217;d have
nigh split your sides, Yeoman, to see Dan yonder a-blowing
and a-blowing till I fancied he was going to burst
his lile self and the bellows, too. You&#8217;re stepping up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
Good Intent? Well, now, I&#8217;ll stretch my legs a bit, I will,
after all this marlaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked in silence beside Hirst, after accepting his
customary match and pipeful of tobacco. It was not till
they had reached Good Intent that the workings of the
natural&#8217;s mind showed plainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan tells me fever&#8217;s come to Ghyll,&#8221; he said, in the
low, dispassionate voice which was always a sign, to those
who knew him, of some troubled reaching-out to his
blurred past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but don&#8217;t you go fearing it, lad Billy. &#8217;Twould
never hurt such as ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was thinking of Mr. Gaunt, I. Dan says he&#8217;s up
yonder. Now, &#8217;twould be terrible pranksome if he happened
to die on&#8217;t himself. There&#8217;d be such a clearing
o&#8217; the air, as a body might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst little as he cared for Reuben Gaunt was shocked
by the quietness with which Billy uttered the wish. This
lad, who was peaceable and kindly of face as Garth street
itself, was asking a terrible punishment for his one enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tuts, lad!&#8221; said the yeoman, patting him roughly
on the shoulder. &#8220;We don&#8217;t pray fever on any man,
surely, whether we like him or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I don&#8217;t pray fever. Couldn&#8217;t if I were
minded to. I just think long o&#8217; what I want&mdash;as hard as
my daft-wits can be driven, Yeoman&mdash;and then I bide
till it comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yeoman Hirst had no insight into the by-ways of
prayer; he said his own on Sabbaths, while Billy was
roaming wide across the moors, and he said them with the
simple faith that was a part of his dealings with this and
with the next world. He was non-plussed, for the natural
at these times was self-possessed, and his quiet statements,
as of fact, unsettled wiser men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>&#8220;Come in, lad,&#8221; said Hirst, pushing the other into the
porchway. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Cilla to draw ye a sup of home-brewed
ale, and we&#8217;ll talk o&#8217; likelier things than fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye, but nay,&#8221; said Billy, after a pause. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
a mind to shut down the forge, and then get home to bed
among the heather. Terrible chap is Billy for playing
all day, like. Then he needs his snug bed under sky-blankets,
Yeoman. I&#8217;ll be bidding ye good night, I.
There&#8217;s a laverock calls me up with the dawn, and he&#8217;ll
miss me if I oversleep myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla, is Billy a fool, or are ye and me?&#8221; asked Hirst,
coming into the living-room and finding Priscilla tending
the geraniums that lined the window-sill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye and me, father,&#8221; answered Cilla, with a queer little
laugh. &#8220;I was thinking o&#8217; Reuben Gaunt when you came
in, and that was foolishness, you&#8217;ve always told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst settled himself in the hooded chair and stirred
the peat-fire into a warmth that was no way needed.
&#8220;So was Fool Billy. He wished the fever might take him
up yonder at Ghyll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla had been thinking her own thoughts; and she
came and stood by the hearth, one hand on the mantel
with its tea canisters and its china dogs. Through the
heat, and the work of the farm, and the fever-dread,
Priscilla was still the coolest and the bravest thing in
Garth. She had something about her at all times of that
starlight strength and constancy which Fool Billy courted
as he slept among the heather-beds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wished better things for Reuben,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I was thinking, when you stepped in, father, that he&#8217;s
done what few in Garth would do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won a fell-race, eh? To be sure, there&#8217;s summat i&#8217;
doing that; but, Cilla, there&#8217;s harder races i&#8217; this life,
and ye&#8217;re daft to think o&#8217; Reuben.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>&#8220;Oh, father no! It was more than the fell-race I was
thinking of. From what Dan said, he is staying at Ghyll.
You need have no doubt of that, as you had this morning.
How many would have done as much&mdash;how many, of
all the folk we know? To run a race, father, and hear
them clapping hands, and know your feet are going nimble
underneath ye&mdash;that seems easy, and soon over, win it or
lose it&mdash;but to wait beside a fever-bed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst stirred uneasily in his chair. &#8220;Now, Cilla, you&#8217;re
letting fancy play the dangment with you, same as Gaunt
always did. Fancies are well enough, lass, but I&#8217;m for
the day&#8217;s work, and beef and ale in between to prop up
all the chancy-come-quick notions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben is for the day&#8217;s work,&#8221; said Cilla quietly.
&#8220;A harder working day than I&#8217;ve had yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst reached for his pipe and sat in silence. Priscilla
rested both hands lightly on the mantel, and stooped
to the smouldering peats, and saw fire-pictures there.
All her love for Gaunt had found resurrection. The shame
that had followed the green, soft ways of spring went out
and away from her. If he could run with the best of those
who ran at Linsall Fair, if afterwards he could face the
quietness of that dread which few met bravely, he had
shown courage of two kinds. His faults&mdash;were they not
all on the surface? He had found little chance as yet to
show his strength.</p>

<p>It was so that Cilla went excusing him; and presently,
as she looked deeper into the peats, she grew angry with
herself for thinking that excuse of any kind was needed.
She remembered Widow Mathewson&#8217;s tale, her picture
of Reuben&#8217;s motherless, untended boyhood. Her heart
went out to him; and suddenly she flushed with keen
dismay. Under all other thoughts was the question
whether it were Peggy who had caught the fever. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
come near to making a dream picture of what might
follow if Gaunt were free&mdash;if Gaunt were free&mdash;</p>

<p>She checked herself. &#8220;Father, there&#8217;s nothing so idle
as thoughts,&#8221; she said, standing straight to her comely
height, and seeking wisdom from the other&#8217;s bigness and
look of well-being. &#8220;&#8217;Tis time I got to bed, if I&#8217;m to be
fit for any work in the morning. Good night, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lingered on the last words, and Hirst, who was no
fool so far as observation went, laughed quietly over his
pipe when she had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s tender, she, with the old man,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Bless me, if the lile fool hasn&#8217;t been thinking o&#8217; Gaunt
again. I know that note i&#8217; her voice. She had it i&#8217; spring,
and it put me in mind of a blackbird&#8217;s when she&#8217;s all
about building her nest. Well, I&#8217;ve known queer cattle
i&#8217; my time, but the queerest of all is women. I like &#8217;em,
for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to banish Gaunt from his thoughts, as a man
of no account, and could not. Like Cilla, he was just&mdash;and
for that reason was laughed at now and then by his
neighbours&mdash;and he knew that Gaunt, if it were true
that he had stayed by choice at Ghyll, was a better man
to-day than he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind ye, I don&#8217;t believe the tale,&#8221; he said stubbornly,
stirring the peats with needless vigour. &#8220;Dan Foster&#8217;s
lad is like others&mdash;light o&#8217; feet, and light o&#8217; thought.
He brought a wrong tale down to Garth; but we shall
know, I reckon, by the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla, in her room above, was less anxious to get to bed
betimes than she had seemed. She leaned at the open casement,
and watched the half moon ride the sky. Not a
breath of air came from the steaming night; it was cooler
within doors than without. The apple-tree whose branches
had lit the window-panes with tender green in spring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
showed dry and drooping leaves; its sickly fruit lay shrivelled,
asking only for a breeze to come and snap the withered
stalks. Even the hills, ranging out and out across
the clearness of the night, suggested weariness instead of
strength. It was weather to help no man&#8217;s crops; but
the fever throve on it.</p>

<p>Cilla had no thought of heat. She had returned to the
cool days of spring, when Gaunt had made her feel the
beauty of this land which she had known from childhood.
She cared less for the man, maybe, than for the glamour
he had brought her; and each proof that he was strong,
was proof, too, that the glamour had not lied to her.</p>

<p>When at last she got to bed, it was only to fall asleep and
dream of Keta&#8217;s Well, and of saunters by the stream, and
softer golds and deeper crimsons than she had ever seen
in the skies at Garth, until Reuben came to teach her what
the homeland meant.</p>

<p>Once she stirred in her sleep. &#8220;David, dreams cannot
last,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;You know they cannot. David,
come home again to Garth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then afterwards she dreamed quiet thoughts of Reuben;
and they were wandering up the streamway that led
to Keta&#8217;s Well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT ten of the next morning Widow Mathewson crept
down the stairway at Ghyll Farm. Gaunt had
snatched what sleep he could on the settle in the living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re needed, Reuben,&#8221; she said, touching him on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>He was on his feet at once; and to the widow it was
restful to find a man who answered so quickly to the call
of need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all but gone. I thought, like, ye might care&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He went up the stair and she followed him. Gaunt, in
days past, had needed the whip across his back; he found
it now. There was no lifting of Peggy&#8217;s eyes to his, no
word to bridge the passage. He took her hands in his,
but they were dumb. There was a stifled breath, as of
one who seeks for air in an overcrowded room and that
was all. Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s had gone out along the
black, hot fever-road.</p>

<p>The widow looked at Gaunt, and pushed him gently
from the room. &#8220;Poor lad,&#8221; was all she said. &#8220;&#8217;Tis one
more trouble added to the peck for me&mdash;but ye&#8217;re not
used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt went out through the porch, and across to the
gate of the croft, and stood there, leaning over the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
bar, just as Peggy had when she said good-by to him. A
great stillness lay over the lands; there was no movement
of bird, or sheep, or cattle; no breeze stirred, and the sun,
stark in the everlasting blue, seemed the one unwearied
thing in nature.</p>

<p>A stillness lay, too, over Reuben Gaunt. He was
groping toward the future. A few days since, Peggy had
kissed him at the gate here, had bidden him return as
quickly as he could. After that there was silence. Though
he had seen her, watched beside her bed, no word had
passed between them. Not a sign of recognition had come
to soften the blow. He could only recall the girl&#8217;s vigour,
her glowing health, and contrast them with what lay behind
him at the farm.</p>

<p>Gradually the numbness left him, and the first sharp
sense of grief intruded. He dwelt unduly on the ugliness
and horror of Peggy&#8217;s death, as though they mattered,
now that the soul had passed. He thought, in a vague,
haphazard fashion, of many ways in which he might have
dealt better with her. He had a senseless longing to have
back that day at Linsall Fair, when he had tempted her
to meet the fever. They might have chosen twenty other
roads than that to Linsall. Mrs. Mathewson, with her
creed that was old and pagan as the moor itself, would
have told him that he was not to blame in this&mdash;that the
road to Linsall Fair was planned out before ever Peggy
lay in her cradle.</p>

<p>Gaunt had known pain of body; but this anguish that
grew keener every moment was new to him. He had no
knowledge of the way to meet it, and such ignorance
makes all men cowardly.</p>

<p>He had lost all sense of time, until a glance at the sun
showed that it was lying over Dingle Nook. He had spent
two hours here at the gate, it seemed. Again he blamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
himself, and thought of Widow Mathewson, and went
back to the farm.</p>

<p>She met him at the door. &#8220;&#8217;Twas kind o&#8217; ye, Reuben,
to leave me to my work; but, then, ye&#8217;re always kind these
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I had left you in the lurch, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay! There was summat to be done, and ye&#8217;d have
been i&#8217; the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at each other, the man who had suffered
and the woman who had suffered much. On their faces
was that light, steady, quiet and full of wonder, which
touches those who have just stood near to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been&mdash;&#8221; he began, with quick intuition,
and could not put his question into words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, getting th&#8217; poor lass ready.&#8221; The widow&#8217;s lips
trembled. She reached out for Gaunt&#8217;s hand impulsively.
&#8220;I should have been readying her for her wedding instead,
Reuben! Oh, my lad, &#8217;tis a queer make o&#8217; business,
this o&#8217; living and dying&mdash;but &#8217;specially the living.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt knew that he was needed, and answered the
call. &#8220;There, mother, you&#8217;re not left alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were few, but the tone of them gave new
strength to Mrs. Mathewson. &#8220;You can call me mother
often&mdash;never too often; it&#8217;s only fro&#8217; your lips I shall iver
hear the name again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout the watch which these two had shared,
no moment had been so full of unexpected tenderness.
The widow was leaning on Reuben as on a trusted son,
and he was standing to her&mdash;not in promise, but in
deed&mdash;as a stay-by in her latter years. The grip of his
hands helped her to face what had to come; the steady
ring of his voice relieved a solitude whose silence might
otherwise have broken down her spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get word down to the coffiner at Garth,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Reuben, knowing how the thought of work to be done
would steady Mrs. Mathewson. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look for a farm-lad
to pass up the fields, and shout to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but ye willun&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve planned it all out i&#8217; my
mind these last two hours. Nathan, the coffiner, wouldn&#8217;t
come within a mile o&#8217; Ghyll; I know Nathan, an&#8217; he&#8217;s
frightened o&#8217; smaller things nor fever. See ye, Reuben!
She was always full o&#8217; fancies, an&#8217; often she&#8217;d say to me,
sitting beside the hearth o&#8217; nights, &#8216;Mother,&#8217; she&#8217;d say,
&#8216;if ever I happen to die, like, I&#8217;d like to be buried clean i&#8217;
the peat, not down i&#8217; a wet churchyard.&#8217; She lived lonely,
ye see, like myseln, an&#8217; I fancy she&#8217;d no liking for many
neighbours, even i&#8217; th&#8217; kirkyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben was ill at ease. He had made no pretence of
godliness in years past, but at a time such as this old
memories revived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you&#8217;d have the parson&mdash;you&#8217;ll laugh at me,
maybe&mdash;but surely you&#8217;d have the parson say a prayer
above her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson had always been fearless in her
outlook, whether it were true or false, and she did not
yield. &#8220;I don&#8217;t laugh at ye, lad, but such softnesses were
never meant for Peggy and me. &#8217;Tis all very weel i&#8217; the
tamer lands, but not up here. She lived as she lived, an&#8217;
she died as she died, and naught alters that. God rest
her soul, say I&mdash;but that&#8217;s as she made her bed i&#8217; this
life. Reuben,&#8221; she went on, abandoning all her hardness
again, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done a deal o&#8217; thinking about religion i&#8217; my
time, an&#8217; never come much nearer aught. Ye might tell
me that Peggy did as weel i&#8217; this life as could be expected
of a body? Now, there, I&#8217;m growing old, or I&#8217;d not give
way to whimsies. Reach down my pipe for me, Reuben;
&#8217;baccy alwus helps me to get right sides up wi&#8217; the world
again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>Gaunt, the ne&#8217;er-do-weel, felt an odd thrill of comfort
in ministering to this hard-faced woman who depended
on him. He filled her pipe for her, and he lit a spill at the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; she said, drawing long puffs of smoke.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a deal to be done, and there was never use i&#8217;
blinking work. For myseln, it matters naught either way;
but for ye, Reuben&mdash;well, &#8217;tis best to get fever out of a
house as quick as may be. It wouldn&#8217;t help a living soul
if silly Nathan stepped up and caught th&#8217; fever, or if
parson came, and he&#8217;s one o&#8217; the few i&#8217; Garth who would.
Parson is staunch, for all he thinks me heathenish. Ye&#8217;ve
faced a good deal, Reuben; surely, ye&#8217;ll help me to keep
fever out o&#8217; Garth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt moved uneasily about the room. He would
have had another kind of burial, but there was no gainsaying
the other&#8217;s wisdom. The village, so far, had escaped
contagion; his own feelings must stand aside,
surely, when measured by the terrible price which Garth
might have to pay for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no right to do aught else,&#8221; he said, turning
to meet the widow&#8217;s glance. &#8220;See, mother, she always
had a liking for the spot where the rowan hangs over the
stream. I&#8217;ve been thinking she might wish to be laid
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow nodded. &#8220;Get to your work, Reuben,&#8221;
was all she said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do to sit idle at such-like
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something near to peace came to Gaunt when he reached
the little ghyll and stood watching the stream, all but dry
now, trickle down the rocky slope under the rowan. It
seemed that, after all, Peggy would sleep more soundly
in her own homeland than in another place.</p>

<p>The peat lay soft and deep almost down to the edge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the stream, and there was little trouble in the digging. With
a touch of that fugitive poetry which was part of the man,
he conquered his horror of the work. He told himself
that she would like to have the stream-song close beside her,
day and night. Death would not be a sleep and a forgetting,
but a sleep that remembered all the pleasant
moorland haunts. And the rowan-leaves would shelter
her from heat in summer, and in winter-time the peat
would lie between Peggy and the wildest storms that
blew.</p>

<p>Fancies crowded round Reuben, as he worked in the
pitiless heat. It was well that they came to his relief, for
stauncher men than he might have yielded, without shame,
to the misery of this task.</p>

<p>He looked up at last, and dashed the sweat from his
eyes. The grave was ready. The heat-waves, running
from end to end of the open moor, danced giddily before
him; he felt the body-sickness which had caught him at
the end of the fell-race which had ended with an over-moor
walk home, and a halt under the rowan here while Peggy
and he talked of their coming marriage.</p>

<p>When he recovered, and could see the moor again in
proper outline, he saw Billy the Fool standing on the spur
of rising ground behind. Billy&#8217;s face showed no trace of
feeling; he stood motionless as some stone landmark
reared to guide travellers across the heath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Digging a grave, Mr. Gaunt?&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>Reuben was too deep in sorrow to be startled. He had
not known that there was a looker-on while he worked,
and Billy was the last of all Garth folk he would have
wished to see just now; but it mattered little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, digging a grave, Billy.&#8221; His voice was tired. &#8220;I
would not come overnear, if I were you, for there&#8217;s fever
come to Ghyll.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;Te-he!&#8221; answered Billy gravely. &#8220;Fever doesn&#8217;t
take lile fools such as me. &#8217;Tis the sensible, wise folk,
such as ye, Mr. Gaunt, that it takes a fancy to.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not afraid. So much was sure. But he turned,
and went down the moor with his easy, loping strides;
and Reuben wondered for a moment, in the midst of his
weariness, what Billy was doing here.</p>

<p>Billy could have given him no answer. He had heard
of the trouble at Ghyll, and instinct had brought him up
the moor to learn if it were Gaunt who was likely to die.
Instinct took him, now that he had seen Reuben alive
and well, down to the forge where much work awaited
him.</p>

<p>Gaunt forgot that he had come. He went heavily across
the strip of moor to Ghyll, leaving his spade at the graveside.</p>

<p>They were strong of body, Widow Mathewson and he,
and it was only a little way from the farm to the rowan-tree.
When all was done, and the kindly peat lay
smooth above Gaunt&#8217;s first dream of wedlock, a curlew
came flapping down the moor, and paused above the
rowan-tree, and wheeled about it in wide circles. Sometimes
it drew nearer, and sometimes it roamed wide;
but it did not leave them, and its wail was piteous.</p>

<p>The widow&#8217;s face was drawn and lined, as Gaunt&#8217;s was,
but she held herself bravely, and her voice was quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happen the curlew&#8217;s her parson, Reuben. Would
she be happier, think ye, down yonder i&#8217; Garth kirkyard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis strange, mother. I&#8217;ve heard few birds call since
I came to Ghyll, and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange? There&#8217;s naught stranger than life, Reuben&mdash;than
life, and what we&#8217;ve put to bed under th&#8217; rowan-tree.
Folk get mazed wi&#8217; chatter, seems to me, down i&#8217; the valleys;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
they fancy life&#8217;s made up o&#8217; gossip, an&#8217; borrowing tin
kettles one fro&#8217; t&#8217; other, an&#8217; quarrelling when one here
an&#8217; there has burned th&#8217; bottom through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curlew drew nearer to them, wheeled above their
heads. Its cry was Ishmael&#8217;s, and the undernote of it was
loneliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yond&#8217;s Peggy&#8217;s mate,&#8221; said the widow. &#8220;She was
allus a wild bird, she, and she never would have settled
down at Marshlands. Reuben, lad, cannot ye comfort
yourself wi&#8217; that thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled gravely. &#8220;Had I no wildness, then?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;That used to be your trouble, surely, in the old
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but &#8217;twas a different sort o&#8217; wildness. See yond
curlew. &#8217;Twill go down to th&#8217; lowlands to feed, Reuben,
an&#8217; to have a frolic, like; but tell it that it&#8217;s got to bide
there for life, and &#8217;twould die o&#8217; homesickness. Oh, it&#8217;s
hard to say it, an&#8217; harder to believe it, but maybe all&#8217;s
for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned for a last look at the grave; then, with a
firmer tread than Gaunt&#8217;s, she moved down the moor.
As they reached the croft, they saw a burly horseman
unfastening the gate with his crop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, doctor, if ye please!&#8221; cried the widow, lifting
a warning hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know you&#8217;ve fever in the house,&#8221; he said impatiently.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I came. I only heard of it an
hour since, as I passed through Garth. How&#8217;s the patient?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Past your caring for&mdash;but thank ye all th&#8217; same,
doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bless me&mdash;Peggy dead? I can&#8217;t believe it. Mrs.
Mathewson, I wish to God I&#8217;d heard the news sooner. I
might have saved her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;I fancy not. She niver had th&#8217; look o&#8217; one as war going
to mend, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve seen many a case i&#8217; my time. Now,
doctor, turn about. There&#8217;s the rest o&#8217; the dale to think of,
an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll not better aught by seeking risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>She told him of the burial, of Reuben&#8217;s help, of their
resolve to save Garth, so far as their own endurance went,
from the scourge that lay so close about it. She spoke of
these matters as of such usual tasks as cattle-milking or
taking corn to the poultry-yard; there was no sense of
heroism behind her quiet statement of the facts.</p>

<p>The doctor ceased fumbling with the rusty gate-catch.
&#8220;I always thought you had sense enough for three, and
now I know it. Of course, I should be a fool&mdash;a bit of a
knave, too&mdash;to go in when there&#8217;s nothing to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson could not restrain the pride&mdash;grim
enough, but clean and honest&mdash;which had given
her strength to meet the years of trouble. There was no
malice in her tone, no unfriendliness. &#8220;They allus said i&#8217;
Garth that we kept ourselves to ourselves up here. Well,
we did while we were i&#8217; health, doctor; tell them we&#8217;ll
do no less, now we&#8217;re i&#8217; trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor nodded, gave a quick inquiring glance at
Reuben from under his shaggy eyebrows, and rode forward
along the ridge of the moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must notify the death for them,&#8221; he thought, as he
jogged along. &#8220;They&#8217;ll never think of the need for it,
so I must. Well, I&#8217;ve not seen the lass, and it will be irregular,
to be sure; but Lord knows they ask few questions
when it&#8217;s a fever case. Soonest hidden away out of sight,
the better folk are pleased these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he fell to thinking of Reuben Gaunt. Mrs.
Mathewson had made it plain that Reuben entered the
farm with knowledge of the danger, and that he chose
to stay rather than leave her friendless. The doctor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
during his years of rough intercourse with many people,
had found less courage in the face of death than he cared
to admit; he himself was as hardened against fear, as he
was against exposure and fatigue, and he grew impatient
when weaker men showed signs of panic.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew what it meant when he stepped into Ghyll,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;Well, well, I&#8217;ve been mistaken in Gaunt,
it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of his day&#8217;s round he was riding slowly down
the village&mdash;his stout nag as wearied with the heat as
himself&mdash;when he met Cilla of the Good Intent, and
reined up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only cool thing I&#8217;ve seen to-day,&#8221; he declared,
with bluff gallantry. &#8220;Bless me, Cilla, how d&#8217;ye
contrive it? I was never one to flatter, but you put me
in mind of a spring flower peeping out of a hedgerow. It
is not spring, child, and primroses are over for this year,
and the heat, I tell you, is appalling.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wagged his head fiercely, but Cilla only laughed; and
the laugh was cool and dainty as her person. Then suddenly
her face clouded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought not to be jesting, doctor. Indeed we ought
not. I cannot keep my thoughts away from those poor
folk up at Ghyll.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor halted, irresolute for once. He knew more
of the history of the countryside than even Will the Driver
did, and now he remembered many rumours, earlier in the
year, that Gaunt would carry off Priscilla after all the
rest of Garth had failed. He had been sorry to hear the
news then; but his feelings had changed since morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best tell you at once,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for you&#8217;re bound to
hear it soon or late. Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s died this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He regretted his impulsiveness, when he saw Cilla move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
unsteadily across the road, and rest her hand on his saddle,
as if she could not stand without support. He should
have let another break the news that Gaunt was free, so he
told himself.</p>

<p>Cilla&#8217;s pride was of different texture from Widow
Mathewson&#8217;s; but it was as strong in its own way, and it
did not fail her when need came. She was pale, and her
eyes were overbright, but she stood upright again and
looked the doctor in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did Mr. Gaunt go there&mdash;and
did he stay in the house&mdash;of his own free will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else should have kept him, lassie? I had all the
tale from Mrs. Mathewson, and I tell you she&#8217;s lucky
to have such a man about her. Pride may be fine enough,
Cilla, but not when you&#8217;re alone in a house, with one death
to cry over and another&mdash;your own&mdash;to look forward
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla&#8217;s face clouded again. &#8220;Is&mdash;is the risk so great
as they would have us believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe not; there&#8217;s always hope&mdash;always
hope, Cilla. And there are two of them to help keep the
boggarts away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet Cilla knew that the old doctor took a grave view
of the matter; his praise of Gaunt, praise such as he rarely
gave, was proof that he thought Reuben guilty of foolhardiness.
All Garth would learn now that its judgment
of Gaunt had been wrong; but there would be little use
in that, if he died in proving it.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she thought of Peggy, and pity drove
away her selfishness. She recalled the fine, careless swing
of the gipsy figure, as &#8220;Mathewson&#8217;s lass&#8221; had passed
her on the moors or going to market. There seemed something
harsh, uncalled-for, in the passing of so brave a
soul. And it was she who had persuaded Reuben to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
true to a promise earlier than she could claim, in those
near yet far-off days of spring.</p>

<p>Priscilla returned, tired out, to Good Intent. The world
of Garth might be small, but the girl&#8217;s heart was big as
the limits of human compassion and human searching
after happiness. The two instincts were so mingled, since
hearing the doctor&#8217;s news, that Cilla could not disentangle
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ye in, now,&#8221; said her father, who was smoking
the after-work pipe of evening, which was the sweetest
of the day to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re looking bothered, like. It all comes o&#8217; gadding
about i&#8217; this heat overmuch. Grown men can bear it,
but not lile hazel saplings such as ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla only smiled, and went up to her own room. She
could not bear to talk just now even with Yeoman Hirst,
the best of all her friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let a maid alone when she wears that look,&#8221; Hirst
muttered sagely. &#8220;I was never much of a hand at tackling
whimsies. I&#8217;d liefer have a thorn-hedge any day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor, meanwhile, had passed down Garth street.
He was thinking mainly of the good meal and the ease
that he had earned, and he frowned as he saw Widow
Lister watering her strip of garden-front. He knew the
little woman by heart, and indeed reined up before she
had darted into the roadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, doctor, I&#8217;ve been trying to catch ye these two
days back,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? D&#8217;ye want to consult me? Shouldn&#8217;t say
much ailed you, by the plump look o&#8217; your cheeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow simpered a little, and cast down her eyes.
&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t what ails me, doctor; &#8217;tis what might ail me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now!&#8221; The other was impatient but like all
men he was weak in face of the little body&#8217;s helplessness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be getting home, Mrs. Lister. What might ail you,
only heaven in its wisdom knows. Let me get supper and
an hour&#8217;s smoke until the ailment reaches you; then call
me in. I&#8217;ve had nothing since a bite of bread and
cheese at noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but &#8217;tis th&#8217; fever; ye munnot jest about it. Bide
a wee while, doctor. A few minutes more will mak&#8217; lile
difference to ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they?&#8221; growled the doctor to himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s
just those odd wasted minutes at the day&#8217;s end, little fool,
that break a man up, come to reckon the total at a year&#8217;s
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he waited with some show of patience, and listened
to this woman who had scarcely had an ache, or done a
day&#8217;s hard work in all her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis this way, ye see, doctor. I&#8217;m not like folk who
have cheerful company about me all my time. When I
sit by my lone self o&#8217; nights, I&#8217;ve allus the dread o&#8217; fever
for company, and I take it to my lone bed wi&#8217; me. What
I want to know is this&mdash;suppose I passed a tramping-man
i&#8217; the road, as I did awhile since, an&#8217; suppose he
looked as if he was sickening, like, an&#8217; suppose&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor cut her short &#8220;Now I catch your drift.
You want to know how long &#8217;twill be before the mulberry
spots come out,&#8221; he said, with a cheerfulness that shocked
Widow Lister. &#8220;Something between a week and a fortnight;
but I shouldn&#8217;t be troubled, Widow. Fever doesn&#8217;t
take the plump little women; it has overmuch respect
for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that truth, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, as true as that I&#8217;m due home for supper. Good
night to you. She&#8217;ll have another worrit before to-morrow&#8217;s
ended,&#8221; he added, as he jogged down the street.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a use for the widow of course&mdash;there&#8217;s a use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
for everything created&mdash;but it puzzles a man at times to
find out what &#8217;tis.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Ghyll the sleepy dusk had settled into slumber.
The day had been tired with its own heat, and the night
was wearier still. Gaunt had stretched himself on the
long settle, after seeing the widow go up to bed. He slept
with that death-in-life which comes from sheer exhaustion,
and did not hear Mrs. Mathewson creep, like a thief, down
her own stair, did not know that the sneck of the door was
lifted quietly.</p>

<p>The widow passed up through the croft and into the
moor. The new moon, a sickle of silver-grey, lay over
the rowan-tree. Mrs. Mathewson, from old habit, curtseyed
to it seven times, not knowing that she did so. Then
she sought the ghyll, and the stream that was too little
and too dry to be heard at all if the faintest breeze had
stirred about the heath.</p>

<p>Gaunt had wondered at the widow&#8217;s strength throughout
the day. It was well that he did not see her in her
weakness now. All restraint was gone, as she knelt by the
grave that was not a day old as yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peggy, my lass! Peggy, ye&#8217;re all I have i&#8217; this world.
Reuben&#8217;s staunch, I know, an&#8217; I&#8217;m fond o&#8217; the lad, but
&#8217;tis ye I want&mdash;&#8217;tis ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weakness of the strong, when at last they are compelled
to yield to it takes its own revenge. Mrs. Mathewson
was bewildered, helpless. Then a blind fury seized
her, and she cried out on God because He had robbed her,
who had so little, of the one thing she prized. And then
there came a darkness, a reaching-out for help, such as
Gaunt had known not long ago at the gate of the
croft.</p>

<p>After that a counterfeit of peace stole over her. She
was on the borderland between this world and another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
and she seemed to reach across and take the girl&#8217;s hands
in her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve strayed, lile lass. Come away back wi&#8217; me to
Ghyll,&#8221; she said, grasping the new hope. &#8220;Ah, now,
ye&#8217;d come&mdash;surely ye&#8217;d come if your old mother asked
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout the night she lay beside the grave, sleeping
fitfully at times, but oftener lying awake, listening to the
trickle of the stream and watching the Milky Way that
streaked the sky with jewelled dust. For these few hours
she had let weakness have its way with her; but, when the
pink fingers of the dawn began to touch the hills, she rose.
Old habit taught her that the day was meant for work.
She was dizzy; her limbs trembled under her; grief had
left her stricken in soul and body. She must conquer the
trouble, that was all, as she had done at many a long-past
dawn.</p>

<p>There had been no freshness, no movement of the breeze,
through the night hours; but now the moor seemed to
breathe at last, as a little wind got up and rustled lightly
among the heather. Not the fingers only, but the broad
hands of the dawn were on the hills. The pink lights had
deepened into crimson, and stretched like beacon fires
across the eastern moor. The grey darkness receded from
the dingles. Out to the west, a sky of tenderest sapphire
brushed the rough edges of the heath.</p>

<p>Widow Mathewson, again from habit, halted to look at
the glory of her homeland. She scarcely knew that the
well-known pageant was spread out before her; but she
gathered heart again, and went bravely down to Ghyll.
She walked with a man&#8217;s stride, a man&#8217;s straight back,
and none would have guessed that she was a broken
woman, asking no more than to keep her pride until the
end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Gaunt, too, was astir soon after dawn. He stepped out
on tiptoe, glad that the widow slept so long, and fearing
to awaken her. They met in the mistal-yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother, I fancied you were sleeping,&#8221; said
Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancies are well enough for night-time, Reuben, but
they don&#8217;t last long after dawn. I stretched i&#8217; my sleep,
I did, an&#8217; I saw th&#8217; light twinkling on the panes, an&#8217; I bethought
me like, that th&#8217; farm work needed looking to.
So I stepped down an&#8217; out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have waked me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, ye were sleeping oversound. Mathewson was
niver much of a man, but even he was snappish when I
wakened him from his sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in this way that she chose to meet the future.
There would be no more stolen vigils under the rowan-tree,
no undermining of her courage. With a sudden gust
of feeling, she understood that Gaunt was the only living
hope she had to rest upon&mdash;and there was danger to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; she said gravely, &#8220;th&#8217; long watch has begun.
The days will seem long i&#8217; passing afore we know
we&#8217;re safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll weather them, never fear. Best not think of
to-morrow at all, but get on with our work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow glanced at him with keen scrutiny. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a deal o&#8217; sense hidden somewhere about ye, Reuben.
Seems ye&#8217;ve been feared to let it peep out till now.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">NEITHER Gaunt nor Widow Mathewson was
prepared for the quiet and temperate beauty that
crept into their waiting-time at Ghyll. If Gaunt had
neglected his farm work in old days, it was through idleness,
not from lack of knowledge. Acquaintance with
all details of field and stable had been bred in him, and
the widow watched him go about the usual round of work
with growing wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hired man would have done half as much i&#8217; the
day, and done it badly,&#8221; she said, finding him milking the
cows one evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;tis only the old proverb, mother, the master-man
always works the better if he has the will. &#8217;Tis not
often that he has the will, ye see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She watched him persuade the last of the cows to be
friendly with the milking pail, listened awhile to the
pleasant splash-splash of the milk. &#8220;Reuben,&#8221; she said,
with a touch of jealousy, &#8220;yond&#8217;s the sauciest beast o&#8217; them
all, and ye seem to have her at a word. She wouldn&#8217;t
let any but me milk her&mdash;not even Peggy, though she&#8217;d
deft hands at the udders. And, Reuben, ye&#8217;re doing too
much. Leave some bit o&#8217; work for me to do, lest I get
thinking o&#8217; what&#8217;s past and done with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll share and share alike,&#8221; said Gaunt, looking
over shoulder from his seat on the milking-stool.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>&#8220;Some folk have queer notions o&#8217; sharing. I tell ye,
I&#8217;ve not been so idle o&#8217; my hands sin&#8217; I war a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the better, mother. You&#8217;ve earned a rest by this
time, while I&mdash;perhaps I&#8217;ve earned a spell of work,&#8221; he
broke off, with something of the widow&#8217;s own grim humour.</p>

<p>The busy needs of the farm were already helping these
two to forget their burden. To Gaunt it seemed strange,
profane almost, that sorrow for the dead should give place
to workaday anxieties; to the widow, who was older in
experience, it was plain that such work brought with it
the gift of healing.</p>

<p>All the routine at Ghyll was interrupted. It had thrived
on its trade in milk, and cheeses, and butter. Now Widow
Mathewson, and Gaunt, and the three pigs fattening in
the stye at the far side of the mistal, were left to drink
what they could of milk that once had supplied half
Garth&#8217;s needs; the rest, save what was needed for their
own week&#8217;s butter-making, had to be poured out into the
parched and thirsty croft.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a waste,&#8221; said Gaunt at night, after they had
filled the bowl in the dairy, and fed the pigs, and stood
watching the rest of the milk run down the croft in a
narrow stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the good farmer cropping out again in ye,
Reuben. Of course &#8217;tis wasteful, but there&#8217;s a deal of
waste i&#8217; life, as I&#8217;ve found it. &#8217;Tis one o&#8217; the things we
hev to put up with, like. Was never good at a riddle, I;
parson down yonder, maybe, could tell us why bairns
are crying out i&#8217; Garth for this milk we&#8217;re spilling&mdash;milk
their mothers willun&#8217;t fetch, or send for, though I&#8217;d no
way risk letting them have it, if they came.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben watched the streamlet die down, a dirty white
across the sun-scorched brown of the grass. Then he
linked his arm in hers, and drew her toward the farm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
set her down in the hooded chair by the hearth while he
found her pipe for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good sakes!&#8221; said the widow softly. &#8220;To be waited
on at my time o&#8217; life, and by ye of all men, Reuben.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the queerness of things again,&#8221; he answered,
lighting his own pipe.</p>

<p>In other days there had been between them the silence
of would-be enmity; now there was that lack of speech
which friends use when they wish to talk together. Once
Gaunt stirred the peats with his foot, and glanced at the
widow&#8217;s face when the fire-glow lit it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeking for signs o&#8217; fever, Reuben?&#8221; she asked drily,
turning her sharp old eyes to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I was, as you&#8217;ve caught me at it. I should
miss you, if&mdash;if aught happened, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naught happens to me, Reuben lad, save wear and
tear. Would ye say that again&mdash;that ye&#8217;d miss me, if
I went out along Peggy&#8217;s road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s none else to care for me since Peggy died.
I&#8217;d had little care, and little love, i&#8217; my short life, mother;
that&#8217;s why they call me &#8216;running-water&#8217; maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her memory went back to the days when she had been
housekeeper to Reuben&#8217;s father. She recalled the hard-riding,
hard-drinking master who had reared his son to
the like gospel. She remembered the night when Billy
the Fool was brought to Marshlands, and was afterwards
turned out into the cold to answer for the sins of other
folk. Many a bygone incident of Reuben&#8217;s boyhood stole
out from those corners of the mind, which hide things
half forgotten. And again she told herself, as she had told
Priscilla on a day of April snow, that Reuben Gaunt had
his father to thank for Marshlands and the money, but
for no other chance in life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; she said, blowing quiet puffs of smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
across the hearth, &#8220;have ye no thought for yourself these
days? Naught matters much for me either way, but fear
o&#8217; death comes natural to younger folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s you and the farm to think of, mother. That&#8217;s
enough to carry me forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he led her on to talk of olden times, for he had
learned already that this was her surest road to peace.
He mixed her rum and milk, and set it down on the ledge
at the right hand of the hooded chair, and coaxed a smile
from her and a crisp assurance, that &#8220;living wi&#8217; ne&#8217;er-do-weels
was sure to bring ye into loosish ways.&#8221; She talked
of Peggy&#8217;s childhood, recounted a score of escapades, with
a mother&#8217;s pitiful and tender regard for detail. She spoke
of her husband, and laughed slily at his weaknesses. It is
in this way that bereaved folk find shelter sometimes,
for their little hour, from the bleak face of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mathewson war as he war made,&#8221; she finished, &#8220;an&#8217;
I munnot say naught agen them as has gone&mdash;but he
war shammocky, Reuben. If it war no bigger job than
sticking a row o&#8217; peas, he war shammocky still. He&#8217;d
start th&#8217; job after breakfast, and put in happen a dozen
sticks; then he&#8217;s sit on th&#8217; wall, an&#8217; light his pipe, an&#8217;
look at what he&#8217;d done till I came out, an&#8217; flicked him off
o&#8217; th&#8217; wall-top; and somewhere about nightfall, if I war
lucky and could get away fro&#8217; my work often enough to
stir him up, he&#8217;d have finished yond row o&#8217; peas. Then
he&#8217;d step indoors, an&#8217; draw hisseln a mug of ale, an&#8217; say
he&#8217;d allus known there was naught like good, honest work
for making a body enjoy his sup o&#8217; beer. Poor Mathewson!
He war made as he war made, an&#8217; he niver varied mich.
Now, Peggy was a different breed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Gaunt listened to her praise of Peggy, putting in
a word here, or a question there, till it was bedtime. The
widow rose at last, and took a rush candle from the mantel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;d best be getting to sleep, Reuben. Ye&#8217;ll lig
on th&#8217; settle, as on other nights? I&#8217;ve had many a watch-dog
i&#8217; my time, lad, but ye&#8217;re th&#8217; best o&#8217; th&#8217; lot, I fancy.
I sleep sounder when I know that you&#8217;re below stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was affection in the glance she gave him; and
Reuben, when he lay down to sleep an hour later, found
no ill dreams to trouble him.</p>

<p>Yet these two had not been open the one with the other.
The widow had concealed her visit to the grave, three
nights ago. Gaunt had concealed the dread that beset
him through the daytime.</p>

<p>The dread awoke with him the next morning, and
dogged his footsteps as he went across the croft. It kept
close beside him until noon, when he came home across
the burned-up fields in search of dinner. He had known
no fear until Peggy died. There had been the hope that
she would recover, the need of constant listening for a
call to the bedside. Hope and the urgent need were gone,
and life for its own sake was sweet again to Gaunt. Fever,
and the all but certain death, had grown to the shape of
Barguest, the brown dog.</p>

<p>He halted now at the gate where Peggy had kissed him
for the last time. He looked at the sun, set high in a sky
of blue that had no soul behind it&mdash;a sky as hard as
beaten metal that seemed to press upon the earth and keep
in the suffocating heat. If ever a man prayed for rain,
Gaunt prayed for it now with a whole heart. He sought
for one wisp of cloud to break the fierce monotony of blue;
there was none. Each undulation of the hill-tops showed
strangely clear, as if cut by a keen-edged knife. The
silence was unbearable.</p>

<p>Gaunt&#8217;s courage, when he chose to enter Ghyll and
share its dangers, was child&#8217;s play to the pluck that now
was asked of him. There was no longer any warmth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
impulse, of zest in sacrifice for its own fine sake; fear had
reached him, and the shelterless heat weakened every
effort at resistance, till there were times when dread
merged into outright panic and set him trembling like a
child. He would recover, win back his manhood with the
dogged perseverance that had won him the fell-race;
then, and not before, he would seek out the widow, and
day by day she found him stronger, more considerate,
more bent on naming her &#8220;mother&#8221; and on proving
himself a real son.</p>

<p>This morning, as he leaned over the gate and searched
for rain-clouds, he went through one of these battles with
despair. When it was nearly ended, and the colour was
returning to his face, the doctor&#8217;s big, fiddle-head nag
came up the slope, and Gaunt started when the rider&#8217;s
voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What news, Mr. Gaunt?&#8221; he asked, reining in and
giving Reuben a quick, professional glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No news,&#8221; Gaunt answered, with a touch of dry
humour. &#8220;We&#8217;re penned like birds in a cage, doctor,
and have nothing to listen to, save this cursed stillness.
If you could give us a promise of rain, now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can help you there,&#8221; put in the other briskly.
&#8220;I ought to have learned something from the weather by
this time, for I&#8217;ve been plagued enough by it. The hot
spell is nearly done with; and now you may call me a fool
for prophesying in face of such a sky as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was curious to see how eagerly Reuben caught at the
hope. This conspiracy of sun and stark, blue sky against
him had grown to be in sober fact a menace; a few more
days of the strain, and fear might give an easy inroad to
the fever.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a sign of it,&#8221; he said, anxious to have his
word disproved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>&#8220;Wait till you&#8217;ve had twenty years more of this queer
climate, Mr. Gaunt, and then you may be just beginning
to know it. I&#8217;ve seen a dozen little signs of rain as I came
up the moor, but I trust more to what old Lamach of
High Farm calls a feeling in his bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt remembered the doctor&#8217;s reputation as a weather
seer. &#8220;I hope to God you&#8217;re in the right, doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m in the right! &#8217;Tis a habit of mine.
Only a fool puts himself in the wrong. I&#8217;m right, too&mdash;under
Providence, of course, d&#8217;ye understand&mdash;in saying
that you and the widow will win through. Tough, both
of you&mdash;not cowards&mdash;plenty of fresh air inside your
bodies. Oh, ye&#8217;ll weather it. Well, good day, Mr. Gaunt.
I&#8217;ve a long round before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt would not let him go just yet. It was a relief
to exchange any sort of talk with another man. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
noticed that you ride past the gate once every day, doctor,
since you knew fever had come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221; said the other testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that &#8217;tis kindly of you. We&#8217;re a bit lonesome, I
own, though we make the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never heard such nonsense! Doctoring is my trade,
Mr. Gaunt, not riding up and down the country doing
good works. I leave those and the credit of &#8217;em to the
Parson. I&#8217;m no poacher. I&#8217;ve a bothersome case two
miles further on, and this is my shortest cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt knew that there was no short cut in this direction,
except to the empty moor. He knew that the doctor
lengthened his round each day to halt for a word at the
gate, and to learn if his services were needed. &#8220;Which
farm are you bound for, then?&#8221; he asked, with gentle
banter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which farm? Good day, Mr. Gaunt, good day. I&#8217;m
too busy a man to answer idle questions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Gaunt went slowly up to the house, feeling more at
peace with this world of heat and toil, and martyrdom.
The doctor&#8217;s boast had not been idly made, for instinct
was apt to lead him right. He had been right in thinking
that they needed physic here at Ghyll. It was no physic
carried in his pocket, to be taken three times a day and
put on the shelf after a dose or two had been swallowed;
it was the medicine carried by all men who have faced
life in the open, that of forward hope and a call to
look up to the hill-tops rather than down to the misty
valleys.</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor has ridden by again,&#8221; said Reuben, as he
stepped into the living-room to find dinner waiting for
him. &#8220;I had a talk with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, &#8217;tis his way,&#8221; answered the widow. &#8220;If aught
happens, like to ye or me, he&#8217;ll not ride by. He&#8217;ll walk in,
Reuben, same as ye did when Peggy war ta&#8217;en wi&#8217; th&#8217;
fever. Men are terrible folk for pranks, an&#8217; so I allus
said. Now, ye&#8217;ll sit down, an&#8217; eat what I set before
ye. A roast o&#8217; mutton, Reuben, done to a turn. It&#8217;s
fool&#8217;s policy to keep your body underfed at these
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of all the details that hampered Widow Mathewson and
Gaunt, none pressed on them more heavily than this need
to sit at meat together. The reek of the hot joint, the loss
of appetite engendered by the long, persistent drought,
made such a meal seem loathsome. Each ate for the
other&#8217;s sake, and maybe the meat, for that reason, helped
them to go forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Niver smoked so mich i&#8217; my life,&#8221; said the widow,
reaching up for her pipe after dinner. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no knowledge
o&#8217; the lad that first brought &#8217;baccy into Garth, but
he did a service to us weak, human-folk. Fill up your
mug, Reuben, and come and sit i&#8217; th&#8217; front o&#8217; th&#8217; fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
an&#8217; talk to a body, like. I&#8217;m fair clemmed wi&#8217; weariness.&#8221;</p>

<p>At dusk of the same day the doctor finished his round
and rode into Garth. It happened, as it had happened
for three days past, that Priscilla was loitering in the roadway
fronting Good Intent; it was a habit of hers, and the
doctor guessed her motive, and responded to it, with the
quiet, charitable humour that marked all his dealings
with the dales-folk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in rare good humour, Miss Cilla,&#8221; he said, drawing
rein. &#8220;D&#8217;ye see those bits of fleecy clouds coming up
across the moon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not looked at the sky,&#8221; she answered absently.
&#8220;It is ever the same these days, and one grows tired of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, but &#8217;twill not be the same when you wake to-morrow.
I was up at Ghyll this morning&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Cilla, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I pitted my weather lore against Gaunt&#8217;s. He
said it couldn&#8217;t rain if it tried, and I said it was bound to.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw Cilla&#8217;s hand go to her heart for a moment, saw
the brightness creep into her face. He had known all
along that she needed to be told that Gaunt, so far, was
well, and it had pleased him to wrap up the news in this
talk about the weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&mdash;they are both well at Ghyll?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;As sound as can be. I&#8217;ve an interest in those two,
Miss Cilla. They deserve to come through it all, and
somehow I fancy that they will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say the chances are against it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they say a good deal of nonsense, time and time.
There&#8217;s naught like pluck for winning a fight. Good
night to ye, and pray that I miss Widow Lister as I ride
by. Three days ago she was afraid of fever; this morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
she caught me on the outward journey and, &#8216;Doctor,&#8217; she
said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve caught a chill that may well bring me to my
grave.&#8217; I laughed&mdash;as I do, Miss Cilla, in season or out,
and &#8216;you&#8217;re lucky,&#8217; I said. &#8216;If I could find a touch o&#8217;
chill under this brazen sky, I&#8217;d be glad of the relief, and
so would my sweating horse.&#8217; Good night again, little
Cilla. Gaunt&#8217;s not going to die just yet, and I begin to
think he might be worth your taking one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla listened to the pitapat of hoofs as it grew fainter
and fainter down the dusty road. The doctor had earned
his right-of-way to folk&#8217;s hearts after many an up-hill
climb, and his power to help his neighbours was not
limited to their bodies&#8217; needs. Whenever he felt that death
was certain, he told his patient bluntly that the next world,
not this, was his concern. While there was doubt, he
thrust down his throat, willy-nilly, the physic of hope and
sweetened the draught, so far as he could, with some racy,
village jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good man goes down Garth Street,&#8221; thought
Cilla, following the other&#8217;s sturdy figure as it disappeared
among the shadows.</p>

<p>The moon lay young, slender as a sickle, over the
parched lands of Garth. Cilla herself, as she stood in the
roadway, looked cool and slender, too, in her white gown,
though she was full of strange disquiet. Her modesty
had taken fright. It was well enough to be anxious for
Reuben&#8217;s safety, well enough to seek news of him as often
as she could; but she knew that it was more than friendship,
this restless eagerness for news. And Peggy o&#8217;
Mathewson&#8217;s should have been a bride by now; and the
peat was scarcely smoothed above her grave.</p>

<p>Cilla, for all her daintiness, her love of clean thinking
and clean doing, was human as her neighbours, and subject
to those gusts of warm and reckless feeling which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
apt to scatter the habits of a lifetime. If she had been
told of another who waited, as she had done, for news
of a bridegroom widowed before his wedding-day, she
would have thought lightly of her. Yet she could only
picture Reuben up at the lonely, hill-top farm; could only
pray for his safety and know that her prayers came from
a warmer heart than she ought to carry.</p>

<p>She turned instinctively to Good Intent. Her father
would be sitting by the hearth, big of his body, big in
charity. She would step in, and have a talk with him.</p>

<p>The yeoman was sitting in his chair, as she had pictured
him. But his pipe lay cold in his hand, and he
motioned her to a seat in the settle-corner opposite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla, I&#8217;ve had a talk or two with the doctor,&#8221; he
began.</p>

<p>She waited, suppressing a quiet laugh that he, too, had
gone out for stolen interviews with the lay priest at
Garth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems Gaunt chose to go in to Ghyll Farm and to
stay there. He knew what it meant before he crossed the
door-stone. I wouldn&#8217;t believe it, until the doctor told
me it was so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, be durned if I&#8217;d have done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; oh, indeed, you would have done it, father;
&#8217;tis the sort of call you&#8217;d have answered, but it was not
asked of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddle-de-dee,&#8221; said the yeoman. &#8220;Black Fever
would always scare me. Give me a runaway horse, and
I&#8217;ll handle the reins&mdash;but the fever&mdash;&#8217;tis a waiting game,
lile Cilla, and I could never play such. I&#8217;ve a sort of envy,
like, for men who can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla lit a spill for his pipe. She filled his glass for
him, and set it by his side. And then she waited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;Seems I&#8217;ve treated Gaunt amiss,&#8221; said her father by
and by.</p>

<p>&#8220;All folk do in Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, they did; but I was down i&#8217; Shepston to-day,
and they had the news, and folk were puzzled. They
fancied that Gaunt was better nor like&mdash;in fact, Cilla,
they seemed minded to turn their faces about and overdo
their praising of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla spread her hands to the peat-glow, and her face
was full of tenderness. &#8220;I told you so i&#8217; the spring, father,
but you would not listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yeoman was uneasy. Praise was due to Gaunt, and
yet he distrusted the man. &#8220;He comes of a bad breed,
Cilla, and I&#8217;m farmer enough to know that ye don&#8217;t rear
good stock from such.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was quiet, but eager. &#8220;We all know his father&#8217;s
story&mdash;but what of his mother? Has she no say in the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, she was well enough, and a long way too good
for old Gaunt; but she died when Reuben was a bairn.
She never had a chance to better his wild upbringing.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, at last, after an uneasy silence, the yeoman
got to the heart of the matter. His fondness for Cilla was
embarrassing at times; it gave him too keen an insight
into any change of mood in her, and he had guessed the
secret of this restlessness which had fallen on her since
the news of fever came from Ghyll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lile lass,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking a deal to-night,
and I wish more than ever that ye&#8217;d persuaded
David the Smith to stay on i&#8217; Garth. Whether ye wouldn&#8217;t
have him, or whether his big hulking shyness stood up
between the two o&#8217; ye and wouldn&#8217;t let him ask ye, &#8217;tis
not for me to say; but I&#8217;m more than ever sorry, lass, as
things have turned out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>&#8220;Why, father?&#8221; A delicate colour had crept into
Cilla&#8217;s face, but there was that steady light in her eyes
which the yeoman feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Reuben is free to go wandering again&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Her treason to the dead seemed baser than
it had in the silence of the road outside. This outspoken
hint of it from another showed all its meanness to the girl&#8217;s
sensitive fancy. &#8220;No, father! We must not talk of such&mdash;of
such foolishness. Reuben may be dead before the
month is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; said Hirst, soberly. &#8220;Maybe I spoke
out o&#8217; season, Cilla. There, lass! Gaunt has done what
I dursn&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m shamed to own to it, and I&#8217;m hoping
he&#8217;ll come through it, as he deserves.&#8221;</p>

<p>So then Cilla came and sat at his knee, for the intimacy
between these two was full of understanding. Her father
was quick to blame himself for the few ungenerous thoughts
that came his way, and she knew how hard it was for him
at any time to speak well of Reuben Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;And not only that,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Reuben may be
this or that, father&mdash;but he has seen Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s
die, and he has helped to bury her, so the doctor tells
me, and&mdash;and, father, I think we ought to leave him
with his thoughts; they&#8217;ll be sad ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was diffident, as a good woman is when she must
run counter to a well-loved father. The yeoman looked
at her for a moment, then laid down his pipe and lifted
her to the arm of his big chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me I&#8217;m a child i&#8217; your hands at times, Cilla.
Oh, ye&#8217;re right, lile lass. There were better and bigger
men than Gaunt i&#8217; Shepston to-day, but not one o&#8217; them
has done what he did&mdash;not to my knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sickle moon climbed up that night till it lay over
Ghyll Farm, that sheltered tired folk who slept. It lay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
too, over the rowan that sheltered one whose weariness
was over and done with. On the moor, where the thin
stream trickled down, whispering a prayer of peace to
Peggy as it passed her grave, there was the keen
breath of life again. First, the moon was shrouded; then
clouds as grey and slight as gossamer came drifting up
the breeze; and after that a little wind got up, piping
thin and high like a plover tired with the long day&#8217;s flight.</p>

<p>It was very still on the moor, save for the soft, insistent
crying of the wind. A wayfarer, had he been crossing the
untilled acres, might have heard God walking in this
sweet and untamed wilderness. The wind, slight as it was,
was full of perseverance, and it began now to shepherd
running vanguards of the mist across the heath.</p>

<p>At three of the morning there was neither moon nor
sky to be seen. A wide sheet of mist, wet to the touch,
hid every landmark of the moor, which, until an hour
ago, had shown plainly all its jagged hillocks, its raking
hill-top lines. And dawn, when it came, could do no more
than thread the mist-banks through with tints of silver-grey.</p>

<p>Gaunt, soon after daybreak, woke from his sleep on the
long settle, with instinctive knowledge that another day&#8217;s
glare had to be faced, and crossed to the window. At
first he thought himself mistaken in the hour, so dark
the room was. Then he unbarred the door, and went
out into the mist. He felt its fingers wet about his face
and hands; he drew deep breaths of it as men drink in
the first spring warmth after a hard winter. Then he
laughed, not knowing why, and leaned against the house-wall,
and was glad to rest awhile, with this sense of peace
and freedom sheltering him closely as the mist itself.</p>

<p>The physical relief, the sense of damp and freshness
after long heat, were part only of a deeper change. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
fever-dread had left him; he no longer felt the wearing
need to hold his courage tightly, step by step through the
day&#8217;s up-hill climb, lest it fail him at the pinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God be thanked,&#8221; he murmured, and went indoors,
and called up the stone stairway: &#8220;Mother, I&#8217;ve
news for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow had slept later than her wont, but she was
awake in a moment. &#8220;What is it, Reuben?&#8221; she answered,
fearing disaster always when an urgent summons
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;The blessed rain is coming. We&#8217;ll have cloudy skies
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s a ha-porth o&#8217; nonsense to fetch a
body out of her bed with,&#8221; grumbled the other. &#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t
dawn, Reuben, surely; winter-dark, I call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down and see, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was soon at the porch-door beside him, and Gaunt,
watching her face, could see the lines of strain grow softer,
as if the moist air had filled their hollows in with kindly
fingers. They stood there, the two of them, as if they
could never have too much of the grey, cool air; and the
heat of the past weeks, as they looked back upon it from
this sanctuary, seemed like that of the burning, fiery
furnace which both remembered from teachings of a far-off
childhood.</p>

<p>There was nothing fanciful about this change of theirs
from fear to strength. Bred in a country which knows
more of cloudy skies than blue, they needed rain after
long abstention from it; and the mist was a sure herald
of grace to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis queer how the weather has ye at a word, Reuben,&#8221;
said the widow presently. &#8220;I&#8217;m keen-set already
for my breakfast, an&#8217; that&#8217;s more nor I could say honestly
for a week o&#8217; days.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>She would not have the door closed while they fried
the rashers and the eggs, though the mist stole in and lay
like smoke about the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t ye go shutting the door against a friend,&#8221;
she said, when Reuben made a movement to close it. &#8220;I&#8217;m
only too thankful, lad, to have the right smell o&#8217; food i&#8217;
my nostrils once again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later that day&mdash;a little past noon&mdash;the mist found
its proper shape and fell in drops as quiet and as persistent
as the breeze that pushed it forward. By sundown
it was raining steadily, and, for the first time since their
watch began, these two slept with no dreams to trouble
them.</p>

<p>When Gaunt woke late the next morning, the rain was
lapping at the windows still, with a gentle, greedy patience
that promised more to come. The clouds were lifting
when he went out into the croft, and there was a blur of
sunshine through the rain. The thirsty ground sucked
in the moisture, and asked for more, and still showed
riven cracks as dry as the molten heaven of two days ago;
and from the pastures a ground-mist rose, as thick and
smoky as the reek from the smithy down at Garth when
Fool Billy&#8217;s fire was being coaxed into a blaze.</p>

<p>Out of the rain, and the under moisture that reached up
above his horse&#8217;s hocks, the doctor came to Ghyll.</p>

<p>&#8220;All well, Mr. Gaunt?&#8221; he asked, with a note of strict
routine in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better for this God-sent weather, doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s your view, is it? I&#8217;m wet to the skin, and
am like to be wetter before I&#8217;ve done. This quiet sort
of rain goes deeper than your quick-come, quick-go
storms. Still, it will clear the air, maybe, and you&#8217;ll remember
that I prophesied it? Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; he broke
off, with one of his sudden glances, as if he were probing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
a patient with the knife, &#8220;d&#8217;ye feel any lassitude; well,
to put it plainly, d&#8217;ye feel the world is slipping from under
you, like a crazy, limestone wall when you try to climb it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; said Gaunt, the new hope and the fresh
colour showing in his cheeks. &#8220;I did, till the rain came;
and I was as near to fright as ever I&#8217;ve been in my life;
but that&#8217;s all gone. Mrs. Mathewson has taken heart,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor looked him over once more. &#8220;I&#8217;m not here
to play Providence,&#8221; he said, with an air of quiet relief.
&#8220;This horse of mine, with his fiddle-head, could never
carry so heavy a burden as Providence; but I think, Mr.
Gaunt, you may let me take word to Marshlands that they
can begin to get ready for you, air the sheets and dust the
rooms, and all the nonsense women like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be needed here for awhile,&#8221; said Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men stood looking at each other with great
friendliness, though in years past their intercourse, on the
doctor&#8217;s side at least, had had more than a touch of chill
in it. Gaunt had not given that side of the matter a
thought; yet these weeks at Ghyll had divided, like a deep
gulf, the old days and the new; whatever lightness he
showed in future, his neighbours would look behind it,
and would see a stricken farmstead instead, and a man
entering it of his own free will to succour others. The folk
of Garth were slow, maybe, to form new opinions of men,
or crops, or weather; but in the long run they were just,
and they did not forget.</p>

<p>The doctor read a good deal in Reuben&#8217;s face just now.
There was a light of happiness in it&mdash;unquestioning,
childlike happiness, dimmed just a little by awe and some
bewilderment. He had seen the look often when one or
other of his patients had lain near to death and had lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
on to watch another spring spread magic fingers over a
world that now was doubly sweet to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not so easy to die as I thought,&#8221; said Reuben,
breaking the silence unexpectedly. &#8220;You never know
how fond you are of being chained to this daft world, until&mdash;well,
till you begin to listen for the snapping of the
chains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be sorry to leave it myself,&#8221; said the doctor, with
his big, heathen laugh. &#8220;They work me to death, and
I&#8217;ve seldom an hour to call my own, and first I&#8217;m baked
with sun-heat, and then I&#8217;m chilled by this mist-rain ye&#8217;re
so fond of, till I scarce know whether I&#8217;m dead or alive,
but, bless ye, Mr. Gaunt, there&#8217;s some queer sort of joy
in life, after all. Besides,&#8221; he added, with his own grim
pleasantry, &#8220;there&#8217;s a certain doubt as to what comes
after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; murmured Gaunt, though he would have
been slow to confess as much at another time. &#8220;I fancy
&#8217;twas the doubt troubled me, when I looked up at the sky,
and felt the brazen heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just my feeling,&#8221; said the other cheerily. &#8220;It might
be hotter out Beyond&mdash;or again it might be damper&mdash;I
never liked extremes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there fell a silence between them, and still the
doctor lingered for the sake of lingering, and because he
knew that Gaunt was weak after long strain and needed
a man&#8217;s chatter in his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly I&#8217;m a lost soul,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Widow
Lister told me as much last night, when she caught me
riding home, and got me to poultice a boil the size of a
pin-head, and then gave me a sermon because I hadn&#8217;t
the fear o&#8217; the Lord in me. &#8216;If I&#8217;d as much fear of the
Lord, Widow, as you have of your body,&#8217; I said, &#8216;they&#8217;d
count me righteous in Garth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>Reuben laughed. He knew Widow Lister, and the
doctor&#8217;s racy tongue had brought the picture clearly to
his mind. And somehow neither wished to get on with
the business of the day, for each knew at last that, in their
separate ways, they had faced adversity with some show
of courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a weakness for Widow Mathewson myself; I&#8217;d
the same feeling for poor Peggy,&#8221; said the doctor presently.
&#8220;I begin to have the like feeling for you, Mr.
Gaunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of feeling, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a &#8216;birds-of-a-feather&#8217; feeling. We&#8217;re up on the
same moor-top, we. There&#8217;s little of the heathen in me,
I&#8217;ve seen too much of human sorrow to feel aught but
fear o&#8217; God. But my God&#8217;s different&mdash;yours is, and the
widow&#8217;s is, and poor Peggy&#8217;s was&mdash;and I catch a sight
of Him when I&#8217;m riding over the moor, Mr. Gaunt, at
the end of a long day&#8217;s work, and the hills get up in front
of my fiddle-headed horse, and the wind blows low through
the heather, and I listen to the fairies. Oh, we doctor-folk
learn a thing or two, when we ride with tired bodies
and clear eyes, over the moor-top home to supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt had not been permitted to see this side of the
man before; and his surprise showed in his face, perhaps,
for the doctor gathered up his reins and laughed shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; he said in his gruffest voice,
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to enter any ministry. Foolish thoughts
<i>will</i> slip out at times. Now, you mean to stay here awhile
longer? I think I&#8217;ll ride home by way of Marshlands,
all the same. Scared as they are, they&#8217;ll be glad of
my news. I shall tell that hulking hind of yours, Peter
Wood, to bring you up a change of clothes and linen.
It was useless before, but now you can burn all you stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
up in, and put on something that doesn&#8217;t carry any memory
of the fever with it. You&#8217;ve burned all the sick-room
things, by the way&mdash;bedding, and hangings, and what
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt nodded. &#8220;And whitewashed every corner afterwards.
Mrs. Mathewson would have it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, a couple of sensible folk seem to be living
up at Ghyll Farm! All as practical and trim as if I&#8217;d had
the overlooking of it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, doctor,&#8221; said the other, with a smile
that had no mirth in it, &#8220;it was a big job we&#8217;d undertaken,
and big jobs are worth doing thoroughly, once you take
them up. There was no need for us to help Ghyll become
a plague spot for the whole of Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the world&#8217;s standing on her head, Mr. Gaunt!
The tough old doctor suspected of leanings towards the
ministry, and you preaching thoroughness. There, there,
I must have my jest. There&#8217;s no offence, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cheery nod and a jerk of the reins, the doctor
was trotting up the moor, leaving the wholesome crispness
of a northwest wind behind him.</p>

<p>At ten of the next morning Reuben heard a shout as he
crossed from the mistal-yard. Peter Wood, the hind at
Marshlands, stood midway up the croft. He carried a
bundle in his arms, and his knees were shaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dursn&#8217;t come no farther, sir, I dursn&#8217;t.&#8221; The big,
ungainly lad was almost blubbering as he stood, a figure
of woe, in the drenching sheets of rain. &#8220;Doctor said
I&#8217;d to bring these, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve brought &#8217;em, but niver a stride
nearer Ghyll will I come. Couldn&#8217;t, sir, if I tried; my
feet willun&#8217;t let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody asked you to. Set your bundle down, Peter,
and I&#8217;ll fetch it when you&#8217;ve taken your precious body
out of harm&#8217;s way. Is all right with the farm, Peter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>&#8220;Ay, the farm&#8217;s all right, an&#8217; th&#8217; folk in it are all right
so far; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, knock all that nonsense out of your head, lad!
You&#8217;ll not take fever, if that is what&#8217;s troubling you. Tell
them I may be home in a week, to stir you all out o&#8217; your
laziness, or it may be a fortnight; it depends on whether
I&#8217;m needed here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s wits were never overstrong, and terror had not
sharpened them; yet even he was conscious of a new note
in the master&#8217;s voice&mdash;a note less easy-going than of old,
and fuller of authority. The lad glanced down the croft,
then up at Reuben, but still held his ground; it was plain
that he wished to get as far away from Ghyll as possible,
and yet that he was held by some counter fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&#8217;t true what they say, sir,&#8221; he blurted out, &#8220;that a
body can catch th&#8217; fever by looking at another body as has
been nigh it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Reuben, with a laugh that heartened
Peter a little, &#8220;it&#8217;s a lie. Most fears are lies, my lad,
and you can tell them so from me down at Marshlands
yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye, sir,&#8221; said Peter, laying down his bundle
in the wet, and making off with a speed that recalled the
haste of Dan Foster&#8217;s lad not long ago.</p>

<p>When Gaunt stepped into the farm, carrying his dripping
bundle, Widow Mathewson looked up from her
baking board.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have ye there, Reuben?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clean linen and a change of clothes. It sounds
naught much, mother, but, Lord, how I need to get into
them! Seems the doctor knew how I&#8217;d needed them, for
&#8217;twas his thought to send them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow laid down her rolling-pin, rubbed some of
the flour from her arms, then looked at Gaunt with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
steady, hazel eyes. &#8220;That means ye&#8217;re ready for flitting.
Well, I mustn&#8217;t grumble, though I&#8217;ll miss you sorely.
Life&#8217;s made up of settlings in an&#8217; flittings out, as the throstle
said when she watched her fledged brood fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not flitting, mother, not for a week or two
yet.&#8221; He was touched by the loneliness, the independence
and the pride of her appeal. &#8220;I&#8217;m needed here, ye see&mdash;you
alone in the house and farm work to be seen to&mdash;and,
besides, they&#8217;d be scared to death at Marshlands
if I gave them no time to get used to the notion of my
coming back. They&#8217;d all be down with fever the next
day, or think they were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good lad, Reuben,&#8221; she said, after a pause.
&#8220;Give me your bundle, and let me set your things to the
fire. &#8217;Twill be rheumatiz ye&#8217;ll catch if ye put them on as
they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the afternoon the sun got out for an hour, for the rain
was tired of its own vehemence. Gaunt put the clothes,
warm and with the peat-smell of the fire on them, under
his arm, and went up into the moor, past Peggy&#8217;s grave,
past the little, grey bridge where the harebells were reviving
from the drought. Just above the bridge was a loop known
to him of old; it had dwindled during the hot months,
and the rains had scarcely helped it yet. The land, for
all the steady downpour, had not slaked its thirst; and had
let only the shallowest of streamlets run off its surface
to feed the larger brooks. For all that, the pool was deep
enough for a bath, and Gaunt stripped, and plunged into
the water.</p>

<p>The glare and misery of the past weeks seemed to
yield to this gentle lapping of the peat-brown water. He
had done his work rightly, for once in his heedless life,
and knew it; and the way of Peggy&#8217;s death, the squalor
and the terror of it, were washed clean by the stream that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
sucked, and laughed, and gurgled round the edges of the
pool.</p>

<p>A curlew came and looked at him, as he splashed in the
brown water. A burn-trout finned its way upstream in
fright when it found a four-limbed monster in its favourite
pool. For the rest, he had no company and needed none.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">REUBEN was home again at Marshlands. His housekeeper
still watched him carefully when she brought
in his meals, and Peter, the farm-lad, stood at least ten
feet away when the master came out into the yard to give
his orders. Only Michael, the head man about the farm,
showed common sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fever&#8217;s like a turnip lanthorn,&#8221; said Michael, a few
days after the master&#8217;s return. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve only to light the
bogie, an&#8217; set it up i&#8217; a dark corner, an&#8217; watch &#8217;em running
for dear life. Oh, by th&#8217; Heart, sir, I&#8217;d liefer face it any
day as ye did, than go running into my burrow like a rabbit
every time a kitty-call sounded over the pastures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little by little, however, memory of the panic grew
dulled. Ten days of rain, with scarcely an hour&#8217;s cessation
now and then, were followed by exquisite, crisp
sunshine, till Yeoman Hirst declared that the face of the
land &#8220;looked as clean-washed as a babby&#8217;s.&#8221; The breeze
was sweet and nutty to the smell. Flowers, checked till
now by the drought, began to show out of their proper
season, while September&#8217;s natural brood stirred into
blossom in every field and hedgerow. It was a season such
as puts new heart into men, whether they admit the
weather&#8217;s influence or make pretence of denial.</p>

<p>The fever, too, had spent itself. In Shepston there was
a case here and there, at longer and longer intervals, but
none further up the dale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to boast,&#8221; said Hirst to Cilla, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
one of these clean autumn evenings, as they watched the
sun go down, &#8220;but it seems like as if th&#8217; fever couldn&#8217;t
bid to touch bonnie Garth. &#8217;Twas afraid to spoil her face,
I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, father!&#8221; laughed Cilla, with that pleasant
linking of her arm in his which was full of comradeship.
&#8220;I believe ye love Garth village better than any soul that
lives in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; answered the yeoman, his voice rising to
a roar of affectionate good-will. &#8220;There&#8217;s ye, Cilla, lass&mdash;but
Garth runs a good second, I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was quietly happy these days, though she would
admit no reason for it. On every side she heard guarded
praise of Reuben; for the doctor, who seldom spoke ill of
a man, was fond of spreading good reports abroad when
honesty allowed it. It was known now in Garth, not only
that Reuben had chosen to go into Ghyll and share its
troubles, but that afterwards they had done all they could,
he and the widow, to keep the plague from spreading
down to the valley.</p>

<p>Priscilla did not ask herself why praise of Reuben was
so welcome. She simply let the gold, September days
drift by, and sometimes cried o&#8217; nights when she thought
of Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson, sleeping beside the moorland burn.
It was Cilla&#8217;s way to cry for others when her own happiness
took shape.</p>

<p>At Marshlands, maybe, the servants, all save Michael,
the head man, relished the changed outlook upon Gaunt
less than their neighbours did. They found the master
more intent on details of the farm and house than he
had been; he went roaming, for a day or two, or a week,
less often, and they were not free to drive Michael wild
with their taunt of: &#8220;Well, th&#8217; master idles all his time;
why shouldn&#8217;t such as us?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;The fever&#8217;s gone to his head, though he thought he&#8217;d
&#8217;scaped it,&#8221; said the housekeeper sagely to Rachel, the
dairymaid, as she watched the butter-making. &#8220;I was
allus telled it left its marks on a man, did fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was right. The fever had gone, not only to Reuben&#8217;s
head, but to the heart of the man. He had never been
trusted before, as Widow Mathewson had trusted him.
He had not been asked&mdash;save when he ran the Linsall
fell-races so gallantly&mdash;whether his courage were sound
as his wind. No one had taught him the way of his manhood
until the time of stress at Ghyll; but now he was
moving with uncertain steps, like a child first finding its
feet, along his proper road.</p>

<p>Cilla met him one forenoon on the bridle-path that ran
through Raindrift Wood. For once in a way he was on
foot, like herself, and not on horseback; and they stood
looking at each other, startled by the sudden meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we have heard pleasant things about you, Mr.
Gaunt,&#8221; said the girl, trying to break down their disquiet,
&#8220;and&mdash;and, indeed, we are glad that&mdash;that nothing
happened to you up at Ghyll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did what was needed, and was glad to be needed,&#8221;
he answered simply. &#8220;There was nothing at all to talk
about, though you know how folk build up a mole-hill
and swear &#8217;tis a mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla glanced quietly at him. He had come out a
changed man from the furnace of those weeks at Ghyll.
The easy, self-assertive jauntiness was gone; his small
affectations of speech and manner were lost; and he spoke
and carried himself as a yeoman should. The restless
glitter, too, had gone from his grey eyes, and the look
in them was of a man who had lately met life face to face.
He was thin and haggard; yet Cilla was conscious only of
some new strength in him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;Tell me of&mdash;of Peggy,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;I was
grieved when the news came down to Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She died without a good-by. That was the hardest
thing to bear. If there&#8217;d been a half-hour given to us for
talk before she went, it would have seemed easier. I was
in need of forgiveness, maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, and his eyes sought hers gravely. Cilla
could feel nothing but a great tenderness, a sudden rush
of pity. He was so quiet under punishment, so ready to
admit that it was well-deserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always fond of seeing fresh places,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Leave Garth for awhile, will you not, until&mdash;until
the memory of it all grows softened?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time Gaunt smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken just the
opposite notion into my head. Marshlands is a biggish
place, and needs a master over it. They will tell you in
Garth that it has not known much of a master these last
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Generous always in compassion, she could not check
herself, but laid her hand on his arm impulsively. &#8220;Never
think that again! They tell different stories of you now
in Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; put in Reuben, with a touch of the weariness
that would keep him company for many a day.
&#8220;They&#8217;re full of praise I haven&#8217;t a need for. By and by
they&#8217;ll forget, and I shall be &#8216;Mr. Running-Water&#8217; to
them once again. &#8217;Tis well to know one&#8217;s by-name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you must not be bitter! I tell you, they have
changed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so.&#8221; His pride was touched in some unexpected
way. &#8220;They call a fresh fiddle-tune, but are they sure
I&#8217;ll dance to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla liked his stubbornness, liked the gravity which
was so far remote from her earlier knowledge of him. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
said good-by in Raindrift Wood, and Gaunt went slowly
home, wondering that Cilla and he could meet, not like
lovers who had walked the field-ways when spring was
warm and urgent, but like friends who were old and tranquil
as this month of gold September.</p>

<p>At Marshlands, only Michael had faith in the master&#8217;s
purpose; the others said that he would tire of farming in
a week or two more, because it stood to reason that running
water must be gadding off somewhere or another.</p>

<p>Michael&#8217;s face grew cheerier as the days went on. He
saw the master keeping close at home; he saw the dairy-work
grow cleanlier, the maids and the farm-lads doing
a day&#8217;s work in a day, instead of taking two to it. Michael
felt no jealousy. He had always had the farm&#8217;s interests
at heart, and had known that he could not rule the house
until the master set his own back to the work of supervision
and ceased from wandering.</p>

<p>Reuben went his own way, as he had always done; but
the new way, he admitted to himself, rang more crisply underfoot
than the old had done. Folk were anxious in Garth
village to show him that they knew and understood what
he had done at Ghyll; they were met by an easy courtesy
that was cold as an east wind, a courtesy that halted for a
moment to talk of the weather, and then passed by without
a wish for friendship. Reuben was plainly minded not
to dance to their new tune as yet, and they liked him the
better for it.</p>

<p>He had found self-confidence. His father&#8217;s history,
remembrance of that bitter night, when, a lad of fifteen,
he had seen Billy and his mother driven out into the wind,
had haunted him persistently, had lain always in the background
of his thoughts. He had grown used to the belief
that his by-name fitted him well enough, that he was
infirm of will and must be so to the end. There was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
claim upon him, save the farm&#8217;s; and that claim had
been too abstract and impersonal until now to move his
fancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill not last,&#8221; he would think, coming home at
nightfall from some journey over the pastures. &#8220;But at
the worst, it can do no harm, and keeps me busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the days went by, he grew more full of wonder at the
change in himself. Little by little the lands, and the smaller
of the farms, and his own big house of Marshlands, crept
into his heart, as a child might creep to the knee of a lonely
man and bring him soft companionship. He had neither
wife nor child of his own; and, lacking these, a man&#8217;s
best solace is love of the acres left him by many generations.</p>

<p>It was no &#8217;prentice hand he turned to farming matters,
after all. The routine of it he knew by training; but the
instinct toward it lay deeper than one man&#8217;s life could ever
sound. And the faces of the lazy hinds grew longer day
by day, and Michael went whistling about his work.</p>

<p>It was soon after Cilla&#8217;s meeting with him in Raindrift
Wood that she was caught by Widow Lister, passing down
Garth&#8217;s highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good day, Miss Cilla,&#8221; she said briskly. &#8220;Ye
look lile an&#8217; bonnie, if a plain cottage-body might say
so without offence. See my bit of a garden here, an&#8217;
how the rain has watered it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla halted, as all good-natured people did who accepted
Widow Lister as a load added by habit to the day&#8217;s
work. She praised the snapdragons, the asters, the marigolds,
which, thanks to constant watering through the
drought, reared gallant heads to the quiet September sunlight.
Then she waited, knowing that this was the prelude
to some plea for help, or to some need for gossip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear queer news o&#8217; Mr. Gaunt these days,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
widow, with a stolen glance at Cilla. &#8220;They tell me he&#8217;s
a changed man, since he was daft enough to step into Ghyll
when he hadn&#8217;t any need to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man enough, you meant?&#8221; put in Cilla quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, well, &#8217;twas like him, anyway, to go seeking a spot
where trouble was, an&#8217; then to run his head straight into &#8217;t&mdash;though,
of course,&#8221; she added with a sigh of demure
resignation, &#8220;&#8217;tis not for me to judge my betters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla smiled impatiently, for it was useless to be angry
with this woman who eluded censure as she had eluded
all life&#8217;s sharp edges. &#8220;Then why judge them, Mrs.
Lister?&#8221; she asked briskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I only say what I hear, and I niver have no faith
myseln i&#8217; sudden conversions. When my man war alive,
I war most frightened when he had his serious, sober fits
on him. I knew he&#8217;d break out worse nor iver when he
made a fresh start for th&#8217; Elm Tree Inn. Mr. Gaunt, ye
see, is as God made him&mdash;an&#8217; his father&#8217;s training no
way bettered a poor job&mdash;an&#8217; that&#8217;s where &#8217;tis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla turned after a farewell that was colder than her
wont, and saw the widow stooping tranquilly over her
flower-beds. Mrs. Lister, indeed, seemed the incarnation
of peaceful Garth&mdash;a trim, little figure tending a trim,
little garden-patch that fronted the roadway, with the sun
finding auburn streaks in the smooth, well-ordered hair
that should have shown a grey patch or two by now. And,
in spite of herself, Priscilla smiled; the widow was so
gentle a wasp to look at, and yet her sting was always
at Garth&#8217;s service.</p>

<p>Fever and the dread which had made strong farmer-men
ashamed, grew half-forgotten by the village as September
neared its end. Gaunt still overlooked the work
at Marshlands, still wondered that this love o&#8217; land grew
dearer to him day by day. And sometimes he met Cilla in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the fields, or on the roadway; and their friendship was
quiet and sunny as the light that lay about the hazel
copses.</p>

<p>He was often up at Ghyll these days, and Widow
Mathewson&#8217;s smile, when she met him in the doorway,
or saw him coming across the croft, was his reward. She
was doing the farm work alone, stubborn in her pride of
isolation. Reuben helped her so far as he could, but he
had bigger lands to see to; and one quiet noontide he
walked up, with a strapping farm-lad at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this ye&#8217;ve brought, Reuben?&#8221; said the widow,
standing stiff at her own porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a lazy hound I can&#8217;t lick into shape, mother.
Teach him to help you about the farm, and send him back
as soon as you&#8217;ve trained him. He can be spared from
Marshlands, now there&#8217;s less to be done about the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, now, Reuben&mdash;I&#8217;m not one to go borrowing&mdash;I
war niver that sort&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;m used to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lad has his orders&mdash;from me,&#8221; said Reuben.
&#8220;See that he does his full share of the work, mother, and
a little over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathewson, to her surprise, found herself yielding
to this new air of Gaunt&#8217;s, half persuasive and half
masterful. Indeed, she was beginning more and more to
lean on him, and would tell herself, as she smoked by the
hearth at nights, that she had earned a little luxury, maybe,
in her old age. This morning she was slow to yield. The
work was too much for one pair of hands, and she was
&#8220;bone-weary;&#8221; but better work till she dropped than let
it be said that they had needed outside help at Ghyll.</p>

<p>At last she consented grudgingly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis only a loan
o&#8217; th&#8217; lad, mind ye,&#8221; she hastened to assure him. &#8220;I
suppose I mun hire one soon, like it or no; &#8217;specially now
they begin to ask for milk again down i&#8217; Garth. They ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
i&#8217; a whisper, though,&#8221; she added, with her old, tart humour.
&#8220;A shout would bring fever out of its kennel, so they fancy
still.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the farm-lad was left at Ghyll; and the look on his
face was laughable to watch when Reuben left him to the
mercies of Widow Mathewson. The master might be
harder these days than of old; but the widow&#8217;s hardness,
and the strength of her fist to back it if need be, were renowned
throughout the dale.</p>

<p>September passed, and still the clear, gold magic made
Paradise of fields and copse. It was now that magic
walked across the fells. The dales-folk had seen the mystery
in other years, but never as they saw it now; for no
man could remember such a spell of drought; and such
a fall rain to follow it.</p>

<p>The pastures, sloping to the blue and amber sky, had
been smoking hot before the rain came; the first day&#8217;s
moisture had been lost, for it was turned to the steam
which men had named a ground-mist. The second day&#8217;s
fall had been lapped up, greedily as a cat laps milk, and
the third day&#8217;s, too, had gone to feed the soil. It was only
on the fourth day that the streams had begun to brawl and
chatter, as if they had claimed all the mercy of the skies.
Like most folk who make noise, the brooks were spreading
an empty boast abroad; they were idlers for the most
part, dawdling down a field-way here, a glen there, until
some miller stayed their course and bade them turn his
mill-wheel for him; but it was the thrifty, working pastures
that caught the first fruits, and turned them to good uses.</p>

<p>Gaunt, as he rode about his lands, could see the miracle
take shape before his eyes. Sharp Fell, away to the southwest,
had been as grey-brown as a hazelnut, withered
before it comes to ripeness; now it showed a tinge of
green, and each day the green lay deeper, richer across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
burnt-up pastures. He had watched this uprising of the
grass in far-off countries when the wet season followed
extreme heat; but never before in Garth.</p>

<p>Yeoman Hirst overtook him one of these days, when
both were riding to Shepston market. &#8220;Seems there&#8217;s
going to be a hay-crop, after all, though a lile bit late in the
year,&#8221; he laughed, pointing to the pastures with his switch.
&#8220;They say Garth weather&#8217;s queer, but I niver yet made
hay at Kirstmas-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say there&#8217;ll be good grazing by and by, and
that&#8217;s something to be thankful for, before the winter
drives the beasts indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt was shy of his fellow men, remembering past
coldness; but with Cilla&#8217;s father he was himself. The
yeoman&#8217;s big, hearty outlook on the world inspired confidence
in all who met him; his friendship, not to be bought
at a price, was counted a privilege; moreover, he was master
of the house that sheltered Cilla.</p>

<p>They rode into Shepston together, and stabled at the
same inn; and Hirst, before he went about his business,
turned to Reuben.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might as well jog home in company, we,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What time d&#8217;ye start out for Garth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four o&#8217; the clock, or thereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can meet here, then. I shall have done by
that time and a lonely ride does no man good, they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode home together through the enchanted land.
Old tradition told of witchcraft here in Strathgarth Dale.
Witchcraft there was, of a kindly sort, and it came from
the hills that raked the sky, the hollows that caught the
farewell music of the day, and softened it, and went unwillingly
to bed, to dream of fairies&#8217; songs. The farmers
who lived in amongst this glamour said little about it;
they were scarcely conscious that they saw it, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
seldom asked themselves any question that intruded into
the day&#8217;s work; but the beauty at their hills and hollows,
the music of their gloaming, were as real an influence in
their lives as the breath o&#8217; God that stirred their acres
into life.</p>

<p>&#8220;A grand evening,&#8221; was all that Yeoman Hirst found
to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, grand,&#8221; Reuben answered.</p>

<p>They came to the door of Good Intent. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll step
in, and drink a cup o&#8217; tea?&#8221; said Hirst.</p>

<p>Gaunt was taken by surprise. He hesitated, and flushed
hotly as he recalled his last visit to Good Intent and the
end of it. &#8220;Thank you, but I must be getting home,&#8221; he
answered quietly.</p>

<p>The yeoman looked him in the face, and his smile
broadened. &#8220;Now, Mr. Gaunt, I know what ye&#8217;re thinking
of. Bygones are bygones, surely, if we&#8217;ll let them be.
Say I was wrong if ye like, though I shouldn&#8217;t like to own
to it. Step in, step in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben could not fight against this bluff, hearty courtesy.
The yeoman whistled a farm-lad round to take their horses,
then broke into the house with a tread that shook the
rafters. Cilla looked up from the table which she was
laying for tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought a guest wi&#8217; me, lile lass,&#8221; he said, with a
genial roar. &#8220;He was a bit loth to enter, till I persuaded
him he&#8217;d find a welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Priscilla was startled, and could not check the sudden
flush of pleasure with which she greeted Reuben. All
three were silent and ill at ease for a moment. The yeoman,
seeing the look that passed between them, wondered
if he had done well, after all, to bring Gaunt under his
roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;The kettle is boiling, father,&#8221; said Cilla, quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
putting an end to their constraint. &#8220;See the cracknels
I&#8217;ve baked for you to-day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst interrupted her by taking one of the crisp bits
of pastry between a thumb and forefinger. &#8220;I always
had a soft tooth for sweetstuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mr. Gaunt,
there&#8217;s your seat. Cilla, don&#8217;t be long in mashing the
tea; we&#8217;re a thirsty couple after the ride from Shepston.&#8221;</p>

<p>When tea was over, and they settled round the hearth,
Gaunt felt a sense of well-being and content for which
there seemed to be no clear reason. So many details
went to the making of his comfort&mdash;Cilla&#8217;s face, as she
sat half in the firelight, half in the dancing shadows&mdash;the
yeoman&#8217;s ready laugh&mdash;even the lingering scent of
buttered toast which carried homely memories with it.
He had a bigger house at Marshlands, but had never found
this fireside glamour there; and always, as they talked,
he kept glancing toward Cilla, wondering that so slim
a lass could bring so much peace about a hearth.</p>

<p>Hirst followed him out when at last he got to saddle.
&#8220;First visits mean second ones, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Step in
any time ye&#8217;re passing Good Intent, and good night to ye,
Mr. Gaunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened to the hoof beats as they grew fainter up
the road; then he went indoors with a sigh, and sat him
down in the hooded chair, and beckoned Cilla to his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re most of us as big fools as we look, and some of
us bigger,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re wondering why I asked
Gaunt to the farm. Well, &#8217;twas to pay a debt, if you must
have the truth. I&#8217;ve reckoned it up all ways, Cilla, and I&#8217;ve
fought agen it, but I like to be just&mdash;when I can. I&#8217;ve
been hard on the lad, and he went where I wouldn&#8217;t have
gone if I&#8217;d been paid i&#8217; gold for &#8217;t.&#8221; His face broke into
broad wrinkles, full of charity and humour. &#8220;Ye see,
lile Cilla, a father&#8217;s never i&#8217; the wrong to his lass&mdash;&#8217;twouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
do to own up to &#8217;t&mdash;but when I see Gaunt
framing like a farmer, and settling down to th&#8217; only good
work God ever put into man&#8217;s hands&mdash;well, I war not
exactly i&#8217; the wrong, ye understand, but happen I misjudged
him, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was pleasant to Cilla, this sitting at her father&#8217;s knee
and listening while the big, child&#8217;s heart of the man found
voice. She understood the battle with his pride, the surrender
to a finer impulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that he&#8217;s fit for ye&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, &#8217;tis early days to talk of that,&#8221; she broke in,
with sudden fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, and early days are best, if ye want to get your land
ready for a good crop to follow. Mind ye, Cilla, I&#8217;ve an
old dislike of the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or of his father?&#8221; asked Cilla shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, both, maybe; but I&#8217;m talking of to-morrow,
not o&#8217; yesterday. I saw the look that passed between ye
when Gaunt came in, and I&#8217;ve seen other glances o&#8217; the
kind. Now, sit down, lass. I&#8217;ve earned a fairly plain
glimpse o&#8217; life, after trying for five-and-fifty years to get
a lile bit nearer to &#8217;t. If ye wed Gaunt, I shall be lone and
sorry, but I&#8217;ll make the best of a bad job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, cannot you understand that Peggy is scarce
buried yet?&#8221; she murmured, afraid of herself and of all
things.</p>

<p>He met her glance frankly, for he had something in his
mind, and meant to find speech for it. It was in times
of stress that Hirst showed all the common sense and
strength that underlay his boisterous good humour.
&#8220;Buried is hidden, as they say, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m telling
ye. It&#8217;s the lesson men have to learn as lads&mdash;and women
after they&#8217;ve had a bairn or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla sat looking into, the peat-fire. &#8220;Well, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
father?&#8221; she asked by and by. &#8220;What is it you want to
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this, my lass,&#8221; said Hirst, blurting it out like a
school lad. &#8220;When I asked Gaunt to come in, it was
because I owed him a debt, like, and wanted to pay it.
When I asked him at the door to come a second time,
&#8217;twas for a different reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father,&#8221; said Cilla, still looking at the peats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re bound to meet each other, ye two, and I&#8217;d rather
ye met here&mdash;-well, as often as in the pastures or the
bridle-ways. I think ye&#8217;re a fool for your heartache, Cilla,
but I&#8217;d liefer watch Reuben courting ye under my roof
than the sky&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla flushed, and her voice was piteous. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
no thought of that kind, father; we&#8217;re friendly, he and I,
and I&#8217;m sorry for his trouble&mdash;-there is no more than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ye&#8217;re friendly, and ye&#8217;re sorry; and I should
know by this time, Cilla, what that means between a man
and a maid. Get me my pipe, lass, and say good night,
and think ower what I&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt, meanwhile, rode slowly home to Marshlands.
The moon was softening all the outlines of the hills, and
owls were calling here and there, making the silence of the
land more friendly, if that were needed.</p>

<p>The man was bewildered by the peace of it all&mdash;-peace
of the hearth at Good Intent, with Cilla dainty and her
father full of comradeship&mdash;-peace of the night, that was
cool and fragrant, and at ease. He had stood too near,
till now, to the drought and trouble of the days at Ghyll
to meet well-being without distrust. Whenever a cool
breeze had met him, with a touch of moisture in it, he had
recalled the heat and the naked furnace-sky that had
shut the moorland in while Widow Mathewson and he
held out against the adversary. Whenever an owl had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
called, he had started, thinking Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s
was waking from her fever and needed him in a little up-stairs
room.</p>

<p>All was changed to-night. The soft, September scents
were abroad, quiet ghosts that promised immortality to
the summer which had seemed to die; the clouds about the
moon were light as thistle-down; the two at Good Intent,
father and daughter, had given him a new hold on life.</p>

<p>He did not know it&mdash;men seldom grasp at once these
hands reached out to them from the bigger sky above&mdash;but
he rode down to Marshlands a likelier man to-night, a
man more brave to meet the future. All that he could
think of, as he slipped from saddle, and gave the reins
to a farm-lad, and went indoors, was the peace that lay
about Good Intent. Cilla&#8217;s clean, homely daintiness,
like lavender; her father&#8217;s uprightness, and the smell of
honest cattle and good horses about him; the peat-glow
stealing ruddy across the yellow candle-light at Good Intent
and tricking the grave rows of pewter, china and delft
mugs into a show of warmth; these fireside matters were
full of meaning to him.</p>

<p>When he went up to bed, and opened his window to
the September night, it was the same tale. A throstle
was whistling a note or two, as if getting ready for the
spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly lad, yond throstle,&#8221; was Reuben&#8217;s thought.
&#8220;Thinks he&#8217;s going to find a mate to-morrow, and then
set to work nest-building. Summer&#8217;s dead, I reckon, and
there&#8217;s a lile, cold snap o&#8217; winter to come before he builds
his nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the house at Marshlands, as Gaunt went to
sleep, Billy the Fool watched the darkened windows. He
was not homeless, because he had the open air about him,
and a bed all ready in the crisp dry bracken up above. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
had no lack of friends; the birds and the four-footed folk
saw to that. Yet to-night he was restless and ill at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy could never sort out his thoughts, like,&#8221; as his
neighbours said of him; but he could feel, and could remember,
and his griefs and joys, because they were instinctive,
were poignant and keen.</p>

<p>To-night he did not grudge Gaunt his house, his cosy
bed, his riches; he pitied him for such barren wealth.
It was Cilla&#8217;s welfare that troubled him. Whenever he
was free of his &#8220;play&#8221; at the smithy, he had shadowed
these two of late, always with the sense that harm might
come to Cilla if she were unprotected in Gaunt&#8217;s company.
At the lad&#8217;s heart to-night, as he stood under Reuben&#8217;s
window, were rage and pity for the scene ended long
ago at Marshlands here. He saw Reuben&#8217;s father send
his mother out from the grey porch on his left&mdash;the porch,
whose limestone white and lichen grey were limned
clearly by the light of the full moon&mdash;and he heard her
sobs as she leaned against the closed door of the house.
He could not disentangle the dead Gaunt from the living,
and Reuben was a standing menace, answering for his
father&#8217;s sins.</p>

<p>Billy, at this moment, was a menace, and one not fanciful
at all. He was content to wait till dawn, to watch for
Gaunt&#8217;s coming out from the grey porch. He knew his
strength, and meant to use it.</p>

<p>A bridle-way ran close to the Marshlands fence, and the
doctor, riding home from a late round, glanced at the
moonlit front of the house. He saw Billy&#8217;s fat hulk, and
from long experience knew that there was danger in the
set of the man&#8217;s figure, his big head lifted to the casement
up above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give ye good e&#8217;en, Billy,&#8221; he said, reining up. &#8220;You&#8217;re
growing fond of Reuben Gaunt, it seems.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>Billy turned with his accustomed quiet. &#8220;Not just
so fond; rather t&#8217; other way, doctor, as a body&#8217;s body
might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, come catch my stirrup, Billy, and &#8217;twill
be play for ye to ride home beside me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fool Billy paused, as a dog does when he is divided
between duty to his pleasure and duty to his master. It
was the word &#8220;play&#8221; that enticed him, as the doctor knew
it would. He laughed abroad to the blue-grey face of the
moonlight, and vaulted the fence and clutched a stirrup.
The madness had gone from him, and left him a child
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;well, then, doctor, and as a
body might say, I was always one for playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The exquisite, cool night lay like God&#8217;s blessing over
the Strathgarth lands. Gaunt, too sound asleep to hear
the doctor&#8217;s voice, or Billy&#8217;s slow answer, dreamed quietly
of Cilla in her lilac frock&mdash;of Cilla, who carried scent
o&#8217; lilac with her, summertide or winter. There was no
memory troubled him to-night of Peggy, and a grave high
up the moor-face which he himself had dug for her; nor
would he ever know, unless the doctor lost his habit of
keeping his own counsel, how near the shadow of death
had come to-night to Marshlands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WIDOW MATHEWSON, up at Ghyll Farm, was
prepared to find Reuben&#8217;s visits grow fewer and
fewer, until they ceased altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stands to reason,&#8221; she told herself, with her half
grim, half humorous outlook upon life, &#8220;stands to reason
he&#8217;ll slacken now, when there&#8217;s no Peggy to &#8217;tice him up
the moor. &#8217;Tis no way likely he&#8217;ll come for th&#8217; pleasure
of seeing my wry face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her judgment was wrong for once. Through the gold
September days and the russet glory of October, Reuben
snatched every opportunity to ride or walk to Ghyll. He
persuaded Mrs. Mathewson to replace his own farm-hind
lent to her, and sorely needed now in the busy life
at Marshlands, with a steady, hard-working man-of-all-jobs
of his own choosing. He helped her with the in-gathering
of the bracken. He took pains to set the new
man in his place at once; to teach him that his work here
was to save the mistress every trouble. All this Gaunt did,
and more, though he could ill spare the time; and in
between he would steal to the little glen and the rowan-tree
that sheltered the stream and Peggy&#8217;s grave of peat.</p>

<p>The widow could not read his motive in all this, and he
himself at no time halted to probe into his methods. Remorse
for his light playing with the love that Peggy had
given him, pity for her end, self-condemnation because he
missed her so little, however hard he tried to feel the decency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
of grief, all played their part in urging him to come
often up to Ghyll. But there was more than this. Those
weeks of heat and fever had taught him to see life with
clearer eyes, to understand the worth of the affection
shown him, in a grim, half ashamed fashion, by the lonely
woman who had nothing else except her farm to love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems I&#8217;ve gotten a son in my old age,&#8221; she said drily,
when Gaunt had taken some special pains on her behalf
one morning of November.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t wonder, mother,&#8221; he answered cheerily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, there&#8217;s a daft thing for a tough old woman
to be doing. Seems scarce modest, Reuben&mdash;almost
flighty-like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke off with a laugh. Her dear, brave eyes were
twinkling with mischief, with a spice of that wholesome
devilry which no healthy woman loses till her death.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does your man-of-all-jobs frame?&#8221; asked Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as well as men ever do&mdash;naught to boast of at the
best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll give him a piece of my mind before I ride
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, that you won&#8217;t! The lad&#8217;s well enough, Reuben.
His big fault, if I must own to &#8217;t, is that he willun&#8217;t let
me do my share o&#8217; the work. &#8217;Tis all the grand lady he&#8217;s
making me, and I was never reared to idleness. Shall be
furnishing a parlour, I, if all this mak o&#8217; nonsense goes
on, and sitting wi&#8217; a bit of fancy-work i&#8217; my lazy lap, and
thinking how many ailments I&#8217;ve gotten, like Widow
Lister down at Garth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt rode home that day, as on many others, with a
pleasant memory of Mrs. Mathewson&#8217;s laughter, the
smoothing of the deeper lines about her face, the power he
had of drawing her mind away from griefs buried long ago.</p>

<p>This luxury of bringing comfort to other folk was growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
dearer to him. It had been left to him to find out,
unaided, that he had the gift; he had had no help when
first he blundered into the knowledge. He was the stronger
now for this lack of aid, and a quiet, yet buoyant confidence
was replacing his old, haphazard jauntiness.</p>

<p>He was often at Good Intent, when work about the
farm was done and he had leisure to stroll down for a
pipe with Yeoman Hirst. Cilla would move about the
house at these times, doing little, needless work of setting
things to rights against the morrow; or she would sit
beside the hearth, and intercept grave glances from Reuben&mdash;glances
which she answered with the same look of
question and of hope. It was their waiting-time, just
as it was waiting-time for the frozen pastures; spring
would have to step in before they found the answer to their
riddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt grows shapelier,&#8221; the yeoman would say, after
one of these fireside evenings.</p>

<p>And Cilla would laugh. &#8220;He was always shapely
enough,&#8221; she would reply demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ay! I was not thinking o&#8217; come-kiss-me-quick
shapeliness, and all that light make o&#8217; moonshine. He&#8217;s
showing his true breed at last, and I&#8217;m glad. His father&mdash;well,
he&#8217;s under sod, and I oughtn&#8217;t to say it, but he was as
near the devil&#8217;s likeness as I&#8217;ve seen yet. &#8217;Twas a pity,
lile Cilla, for the Gaunts go back to Norman William or
thereabouts, and there have been few black sheep i&#8217; the
flock. Now, get to bed wi&#8217; your fancies, lass. I&#8217;ve said
as much as a cautious man ever dare say i&#8217; praise o&#8217;
Wastrel Reuben; but I&#8217;ve seen your daft looks&mdash;yours
and his across the hearth, all as if there&#8217;s never been a
couple wanted to wed before&mdash;and you must gang your
own gait, for Lord help the man who tries to stop ye, slim
as ye are.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>Exhausted by his eloquence, Hirst would reach out for
his mug of ale, and Cilla would go softly up the stair, with
shame in her cheeks and peace at her heart. She would
lean at the open window, not knowing that the night wind
blew cold, and would see new beauties in the moonlit
street, the moonlit, hazy fields beyond.</p>

<p>It was to be the bitterest winter known for fifty years
in Strathgarth. Yet, when December came, and the frost
strengthened its grip, and all the land began to wear a
pinched and sullen look, Gaunt felt the warmth of life
increase. He lost his dogged recollection of former slights
when meeting his neighbours at market or along the highways,
just as they had long been willing to admit that their
settled judgment of a man might, for once, be wrong. They
heard his laugh less often now, but it was heartier when it
came, and one they liked to hear. By gradual stages he
was settling into his true position as master of the biggest
and the oldest farm in Garth.</p>

<p>Hard work was asked of him that winter. Before
Christmas there was a three days&#8217; snow that drifted over
every sheep ungathered from the higher lands. When
his own ewes were recovered&mdash;and he took more than
his share of a labour asking great patience and endurance&mdash;he
made his way as best he could to Ghyll Farm, getting
along by the wall-tops mostly, to see how Widow Mathewson
was faring.</p>

<p>He found her helping the man to clear the last fall of
snow away from the space between the house-front and
the well; her cheeks were ruddy, and her voice rang crisp
and almost merry, when she saw Reuben struggling
through the croft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, but this has been what parson would call a
visitation!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;&#8217;Tis sweeping we&#8217;ve been, an&#8217;
sweeping all ower again an hour or two after; we&#8217;d have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
lost our way to the well-spring if we hadn&#8217;t. It was kind o&#8217;
ye to come, Reuben. You&#8217;d no easy journey, I reckon, up
th&#8217; moor. It must hev been like climbing a feather-bed
set on end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was, mother, when the walls didn&#8217;t help me;
but I&#8217;d a fancy you might need me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now had ye?&#8221; said the widow crisply. She was always
apt to lose ten years of her sorrow when fighting
one day&#8217;s inclement weather. &#8220;Because o&#8217; my sheep all
overblown up the moor? Ye should never waste pity,
Reuben; there&#8217;s little enough about, and &#8217;tis precious,
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have them safe, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe? I learned farming while ye were i&#8217; your cradle,
and that means I learned weather, too. We&#8217;d a lile soft
spell o&#8217; warmth last week? And ye never dreamed it
meant snow to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Gaunt admitted. &#8220;I fancied an open spell
was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you bred i&#8217; Strathgarth, and to know so little of
her whimsies! That&#8217;s how she fools ye every winter&mdash;a
bout o&#8217; cold that starves the marrow i&#8217; your bones, and
then a week o&#8217; softness just to &#8217;tice ye on. Oh, I&#8217;m old
to Strathgarth, lad; and soon as ever the warm snap
came, I says to lad Michael here: &#8216;Michael,&#8217; I says,
&#8216;we&#8217;ll gather the ewes under shelter.&#8217; And Michael, being
young and a man, and a bit daft, says &#8216;no.&#8217; And I says
&#8216;yes,&#8217; and had to threaten to clout his lugs before he found
persuasion. A few folk find religion, Reuben; but &#8217;tis
persuasion finds the many.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael, the man-of-all-jobs, had been standing discreetly
in the rear. The bravest folk had a trick of standing
out of the widow&#8217;s reach. And suddenly he gave a
great, loutish laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis this way, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; he explained, with some
show of haste. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help laughing, I. You told
me, first you found me a job here, I was to look after
missus. Well, durned if I haven&#8217;t a fancy, like, that the
boot&#8217;s on t&#8217; other leg. <i>She&#8217;s looking after me</i>, and I can&#8217;t
help myseln. But she&#8217;s good at the weather, she is, I
own,&#8221; he added reflectively. &#8220;She&#8217;s saved me a lot o&#8217;
trouble, all through in-gathering them ewes afore she&#8217;d
right or sense in thinking it war going to snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the shippon to be cleared, soon as ye&#8217;ve done
idling wi&#8217; your broom, Michael,&#8221; said the widow. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll
take cold, in this weather, lad, if ye don&#8217;t bustle about a
bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael slouched off shamefacedly; and Mrs. Mathewson,
as she made Gaunt welcome in the living-room, surprised
him by her cheeriness. It was only when he stood
at the porch, to find his way down the moor again&mdash;through
hazard of the snowdrifts, as he had come&mdash;that
the widow reached out to him for help. She had gathered
in her sheep; she was wise enough to know the look of
the sky, and the way of a Strathgarth winter; but she
was lonely and forlorn, for all that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; she said, gently, &#8220;the snow&#8217;s three feet or
more over Peggy&#8217;s grave. It has drifted into the little
glen, and the rowan-tree&#8217;s half hidden. I can&#8217;t thole the
thought o&#8217; my lass lying up yonder i&#8217; the cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snow covers warm, mother, so they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, so they say; but I can&#8217;t believe it, when I see th&#8217;
glen. I could bear it better when th&#8217; days were soft and
pleasant, and maybe a throstle whistling i&#8217; the rowan, or a
starling plucking at the berries just ower Peggy&#8217;s head;
it seemed friendly-like&mdash;Reuben, I war never one for
prayer,&#8221; she broke off, with sudden passion, &#8220;but I tell ye
I&#8217;ve worn my knees raw wi&#8217; asking God to gi&#8217;e me back my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
lass. There war no answer; stands to reason there couldn&#8217;t
be. One silly old woman bleating like a ewe that&#8217;s lost
her lamb, bleating right up into th&#8217; big, empty sky, Reuben,
and thinking she&#8217;d get an answer. &#8217;Twould be enough
to make me laugh, if I didn&#8217;t cry, instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt was dismayed by this glimpse allowed him of
the strong, tireless tragedy underlying the woman&#8217;s mask
of tartness and half humorous self-control. And the
widow, seeing his trouble, passed a hand across her eyes;
her smile was like a break of sunlight, that can brighten
the wintry fields but not thaw them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though to be sure, &#8217;tis outrageous for a tough old
bit of bog-thorn like me to be reckoning to have feelings
o&#8217; my own. Why, &#8217;tis near as foolish as to find a son i&#8217;
my old age&mdash;a son all ready-made, so to say, like Moses
in the bulrushes. Ye&#8217;d best be getting down to the moor,
for it wouldn&#8217;t do to let dark overtake ye. Good-by,
Reuben; ye&#8217;re a good lad to me these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She left him abruptly to have her cry out indoors and
get done with it. Gaunt watched her out of sight, then
turned the shoulder of the farmstead and made his way,
not down but up the moor. The track to Peggy&#8217;s grave
was marked plainly by Widow Mathewson&#8217;s big, manlike
boots.</p>

<p>There was something strangely sad and lonely in this
path of sorrow, in the look of the regular, deep footprints,
limned sharply, even to the impress of the nails, by the
bitter, east wind frost. There was something lonelier
still in the look of the glen above, which now lay almost
level with the moor. The upper branches of the rowan
were all that broke the white, unending spaces, reaching
out to a grey-black sky that showed dirty by contrast
with the virgin white beneath.</p>

<p>Gaunt understood how hard it was to believe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
country saying that &#8220;snow covers warm.&#8221; An incongruous
memory came to him of the evening, little more than
four months ago, when Peggy and he had crossed from
Linsall Fair, and had been glad of the rowan&#8217;s shelter, the
cool tinkle-tankle of the stream, after the parched heat of
the uplands. He saw the girl&#8217;s look of splendid vigour and
high spirits, the light in her eyes, as he stooped to kiss her
and she reached up her lips with reckless zest in life and
laughed: &#8220;Yes, Reuben, with a will and a half, if only
because you won the fell-race to-day.&#8221; He could see the
red scarf at her breast, setting off, as she knew well enough,
her gipsy beauty. He could feel his heart beat with eagerness
as he asked her to marry him, thinking, in the moment&#8217;s
overmastering passion, that he could be faithful
to any but Priscilla of the Good Intent.</p>

<p>And this was the end of it all. The stream frozen down
to the pebbles that lined its bed; three feet of snow lay over
the spot where they had kissed in the cool of a summer&#8217;s
evening; and Peggy&mdash;Peggy, with her gipsy eyes, and
her flaunting, crimson scarf and her wild, unstinting love
for him&mdash;lay under a shroud of the moor&#8217;s making.</p>

<p>There comes an end to a man&#8217;s power to feel further
grief, at these times of martyrdom self-imposed. The wise
God has seen to that. Reuben turned at last, his shoulders
bent, and went down the track which Peggy&#8217;s mother had
made for him. Then he made his way home, as he had
come, along the wall-tops, or across the higher spits of
land which the wind had cleared, or by any way that
served. His housekeeper, when he came into the house
at dusk, said to herself that he looked like a broken man,
and wondered at the cause.</p>

<p>As for Reuben, he was no way broken. The fierce,
cold wind of remorse and grief for others had bent him
level with the ground, but could not break him; for a man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
character rides always high, as the stars do, above the
moment&#8217;s weather. To-morrow he would take up his
work, with a still firmer hand, maybe, than before; to-morrow
he would find his way again to Ghyll, enticed
there by a face not young at all, a face on which grief and
weather between them had traced strange patterns. There
was real tenderness at the heart of this man who had
shown so many faces to the world, and Widow Mathewson
had chosen a good son, after all, on whom to lean.</p>

<p>At dusk of the same day, as Gaunt was dragging his
tired feet through the drift that lay between the road and
his own garden fence, the evening mail came into Garth.
Instead of three horses, there were four, and they were
sending clouds of steam down the tracks of the frosty
wind. Will the Driver pulled up at the cottage which
served Garth as post-office and shop of all trades. His
hands were chilled stiff as the beads of foam on the
harness, but his laugh was warm as ever when Daniel,
the postmaster, came out from selling a penn&#8217;orth of
toffee to receive Her Majesty&#8217;s mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not snowed up yet?&#8221; asked Daniel, shivering a little
in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. No, Daniel. Not just yet. You&#8217;re the ninety-and-ninth
that has asked me that question along the road,
and I&#8217;m fair tired of answering. We&#8217;ve kept a way open
somehow, but durned if we can hold out against another
fall. Gee-up, Captain! Your hoofs are balled under
with snow, and my hands and feet are as cold as a jilted
lass, but Her Majesty wouldn&#8217;t like us to be much later
than we are already. Gee-up, Captain!&#8221;</p>

<p>His cattle were getting fairly under way by the time he
reached Widow Lister&#8217;s door. He had hoped for once
to escape the plump little woman whose only business in
life was to stop busy men on the highway; yet he pulled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
up, with weary deference to habit, as he saw her lying in
wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not snowed in yet?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Her slanting glance, over-coy for her years, the sleek,
well-fed look of the woman, found the secret corner where
Will kept his temper hidden. &#8220;You&#8217;re the hundredth,&#8221;
he snapped, &#8220;and I knew I&#8217;d find the last straw nigh
your door, or thereabouts. Seems to me you keep a stack
of such-like straws. What is it, Widow? We&#8217;re late, and
Captain is as cross as ever I saw a horse in my long time of
driving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, &#8217;tis the Captain&#8217;s master that&#8217;s cross. Shame on
ye, Will, to be grumbling at such weather as God sends.
Who are we to grumble?&#8221;</p>

<p>Will waited in exasperation. The widow was &#8220;nimble
as a weathercock,&#8221; as he put it to himself, &#8220;and could
always place a right-thinking man in the wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be getting impatient. I only asked if ye
were snowed up, or not. Surely a civil body can ask a
civil question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shouldn&#8217;t be here if I was, but to-morrow I
may be,&#8221; he added, with cheerful malice. &#8220;I doubt, as
it is, if I can get as far as Keta&#8217;s Well to-night. The drifts
were six feet high up the road, so they tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There now! If ever I want a thing, and must have it,
there&#8217;s sure to be a cross. Ay, just another cross. Widows,
living lonely like and helpless, were meant to bear
&#8217;em, I reckon. I was going to ask you to bring&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of Will, he did not wait
for a wayside command. His feet and hands were half
frozen; that mattered little; but his horses were in risk
of catching a chill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee-up, Captain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring it, bird cage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
or eight-day clock, or what not, Widow, when the weather&#8217;s
a shade milder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla heard the running shuffle of hoofs on frozen snow
as the mail went past Good Intent. She was sitting in
the firelight, and Hirst, just returned from bringing sheep
down to the fold, was dozing by the hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the mail, father. &#8217;Tis time we had a letter
between us, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, lile lass?&#8221; he asked, rousing himself, as he always
did, at the sound of Cilla&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mail has just passed. I was thinking a letter
of some kind would be welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were ye, now? I could have understood that better
if&mdash;well, if somebody had been away fro&#8217; Garth instead
of biding at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla winced under her father&#8217;s jovial pleasantry. She
knew that he referred to Gaunt, and during these days of
waiting and uncertainty she was sensitive to the least
hint that they were free to care for each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is only that news from outside is pleasant,
father, when the snow shuts us in for so long together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ye&#8217;ve got your wish,&#8221; said Hirst, rising lazily
as a knock sounded on the outer door of the porch.
&#8220;That&#8217;s Harry the Post, if I know a knock when I hear
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla waited with a pleasant feeling of expectancy, as
her father opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evening!&#8221; came Postman Harry&#8217;s gruff voice. &#8220;Just
a lile letter fro&#8217; Canada. &#8217;Twill be fro&#8217; David, as I said to
myseln soon as ever I saw the writing and the mark. I&#8217;ll
step in, after my round&#8217;s finished, and hear what news
he gi&#8217;es ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>This easy handling of the mail&#8217;s privacy, was one of
Garth&#8217;s usual customs, and Hirst assented. &#8220;Ay, step in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
Harry. News and a cup o&#8217; summat warm&mdash;ye&#8217;ll need it,
with all the snow ye&#8217;ve got to trudge through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All i&#8217; the year&#8217;s work! I&#8217;ll be glad to hear news o&#8217;
David, I own. Terrible pitiful thing, as I says to Daniel
just now while sorting my mail&mdash;terrible daft thing to
think of a steady, straight set-up Garth man choosing to
waste his time i&#8217; them furrin parts. Garth&#8217;s good enough
for me, though plague take her weather. Well, I must
be trudging.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was standing at the table, a puzzled frown on her
face. She scarcely heard Harry&#8217;s chatter. The wished-for
letter had come; it happened to be from David;
and her only feeling was one of indifference. It had been
different not many months since in the early weeks of her
shame and loneliness, after bidding Reuben keep faith
with Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s. She had welcomed the
first letter from Canada, had read and reread it, had taken
courage from the strength underlying David&#8217;s crude sentences
and simple penmanship. She had needed him then.
And now?</p>

<p>&#8220;Art in a day-dream, lass,&#8221; roared Hirst, tearing the
letter open as he came in again. &#8220;Here&#8217;s news from an
old friend o&#8217; yours. Sit down by the hearth, Cilla, and let&#8217;s
see what&#8217;s doing out i&#8217; Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst read the scrawled pages with some difficulty, laid
them down on the settle, and glanced across at Cilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s news with a vengeance. David&#8217;s coming
home i&#8217; the spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So soon?&#8221; asked Cilla, with sudden disquiet. &#8220;It
seems a far journey for so short a stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he thinks, too. He&#8217;s never what you would call
bitter, isn&#8217;t lad David, but he comes near to &#8217;t this time.
His aunt Joanna, it seems, has found a man to her liking,
and is going to be wed before long. She wants David<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
about her till the wedding-day&mdash;trust Joanna for that&mdash;but
not a minute later. The only thing David finds pleasant
in the business is his longing to be home in Garth
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla&#8217;s interest was roused, as it always was by injustice.
&#8220;But, father, she might have thought of that before
sending in such haste for David. It was not as if she asked
him to step across to the next parish. He left his work
here, to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Joanna never did think, save for herself. Bless
me, I can see her smile and her easeful way of asking other
folk to do her work&mdash;just such another as Widow Lister.
Ye can&#8217;t argue about such women, Cilla; ye can only
laugh, as ye would at a babby. So David&#8217;s coming home!
Well! &#8217;tis good news, say I. What say ye, Cilla?&#8221; he
added, with a shrewd glance across the hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, father. Who would not be glad to see him
again? He&#8217;s so kind, and steady, and ready to help everybody
foolishly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said the yeoman, with a laugh that was half
a sigh. &#8220;He&#8217;s all that never i&#8217; this world could tempt a
lass. Male birds should wear brighter colours, eh?
Read what he says there,&#8221; he added, reaching out for
the letter, and putting his finger on the scrawled
postscript.</p>

<p>Cilla read the few words, then sat with the letter in her
lap. The message was so brief, so clumsily put in its dumb
appeal; yet it brought a sudden rush of tears to the girl&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Cilla&#8221;&mdash;she could almost hear the man&#8217;s slow
voice speaking to her from away in Canada&mdash;&#8220;tell Cilla
I&#8217;ve seen a deal that she used to want to see, what she
called &#8216;all beyond Garth hills.&#8217; I can tell her about
strange lands now, if I can bring my slow tongue to it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
Maybe she&#8217;ll find me polished up a bit, not just so sleepy,
like. And anyway, if she&#8217;s free, it stands to sense I haven&#8217;t
changed, any more than I&#8217;ve altered i&#8217; my wish to see
Garth village again.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all; but the message brought many memories
to Priscilla. It painted for her every joy, and heartache,
each bewilderment, that had followed Reuben Gaunt&#8217;s
return to Garth last spring. She remembered how Reuben
had first caught her fancy by talk of &#8220;all beyond Garth
hills&#8221;; she recalled David&#8217;s dogged persistence in his
faith that the old homeland was better than the new
countries he had never seen, his jealousy of Gaunt&#8217;s glib
speech and wider experience. So much had been possible
to David then, if only he had known it; he could have
pitted his strength and sturdiness against the other&#8217;s
debonair persuasiveness; he might have appealed to the
trust and comradeship that had held between them
since the days when she was a lass in pinafores, and
David a hulking lad of twenty who had eyes for no one
else.</p>

<p>Yet Cilla knew that it could never have been. In some
instinctive way, without thinking it in so many words,
she knew that David was not meant to have a wife of his
own and&mdash;and all that followed, if God willed. Looking
into the sleepy peat-glow, Cilla sat aloof for a moment
from her own perplexities. She saw David clearly, as
we seldom find opportunity or leisure to view our neighbours,
saw him with the grey, soft light of renunciation
about him. It was David who had made Billy the Fool
a working member of the busy hive at Garth, simply by
persuading him that work was play. It was David who
had mended Widow Lister&#8217;s clocks, and bird cages,
and window-fasteners, long after the patience of other
men had been exhausted. It was David who loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
Garth, and all Garth&#8217;s ways, and all Garth&#8217;s frets and
whimsies, who had gone overseas to help a kinswoman
in fanciful distress.</p>

<p>Cilla turned to the letter, and read the postscript again;
and she was surprised when her father, rising with great
noise from the hooded chair opposite, told her she was
crying. He patted her roughly on her head, as if she were
a sheep-dog, and stamped up and down the room, and
returned to ask her what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, father, nothing. I&#8217;m tired of this snow,
maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll just go and tell Garth folk that David&#8217;s
coming back. They&#8217;ll like to hear it,&#8221; said Hirst, who,
like all men, had a secret cupboard where he hid his one,
favourite cowardice. &#8220;Could never abide tears myself,
lile Cilla. Live and let live, I allus did say. Men were
made for work, and they&#8217;d best leave women alone while
tears are brewing up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Widow Lister was patrolling her door-front when he
went by. &#8220;There&#8217;s luck for a body,&#8221; muttered Hirst,
ruefully, as he caught sight of the plump little figure.
&#8220;Enjoying a walk i&#8217; the snow?&#8221; he asked, as he went by.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had enough of it myself, trapesing all up and
down the pastures since dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lone body must do something,&#8221; answered the widow
plaintively. &#8220;I get weary-like o&#8217; my thoughts, sitting wi&#8217;
the firelight only for company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say, I dare say,&#8221; assented Hirst, his big, foolish
heart melted at once by this deftly suggested picture of
the lonely hearth. &#8220;Cilla must come in oftener, to chat
wi&#8217; ye at nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or perhaps ye&#8217;d find time now and then to step in
yourself?&#8221; murmured the other, her eyes lifted &#8220;kitten-soft&#8221;
to his in the moonlight. &#8220;There&#8217;s something in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
the way a man sits in his chair an&#8217; the smell of his pipe
smoke that&#8217;s cheering to a body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst was as free from vanity as most hearty, well-set-up
men, but he had felt more than one doubt of the widow&#8217;s
friendliness in years gone by; and to-night he took a hasty
step or two away from her, like a bird that sees the snare
being set. &#8220;Why, yes!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;To be sure, I&#8217;ll
step in some night, and bring Cilla with me&mdash;and bring
Cilla with me. Ye&#8217;ll have David back in Garth, too, in
the spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; said the widow. &#8220;There&#8217;s that
little job still waiting to be done, and it&#8217;s rankled a bit,
as I told ye; and now I can give him a piece o&#8217; my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; growled Hirst, as he moved down the street.
&#8220;Good night to ye. I&#8217;d thought ye might like to see
David back for his own sake, not for what he can do for
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he neared the forge, a broad shaft of crimson lay
across the blue-white, moonlit road, a vivid splash of
colour that flickered in long, waving lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Billy&#8217;s at play. Never knew such a lad for playing
early and playing late. He&#8217;ll be glad o&#8217; my news, I reckon,&#8221;
thought Hirst, as he moved to the smithy door and stood
looking in.</p>

<p>Dan Foster&#8217;s lad was busy at the bellows, and Billy
was standing at his anvil. He looked a huge, heroic figure
as he brought the hammer down, his arms thick and
brawny, his head throwing out a fantastic shadow of
itself on the wall behind. A cheerful scent came from
within the forge, an odour made up of red-hot iron, and
fire heat, and hoof parings from recent shoeing. The yeoman
would know that smell of Garth forge, bringing
memories of other days with it, if you set him blindfold,
after years of absence, at the door. The contrast, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
between the nipping frost one side the threshold, the royal
warmth on the other, was pleasant, like a spring day found
unexpectedly at Christmas time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, my lad, David comes back with the spring,&#8221; said
Hirst, his natural voice striking easily across the uproar
of the bellows and the anvil.</p>

<p>Billy, as befitted one who was short of wit, went on with
the work in hand and finished it before he turned about.
He was none of your wise fellows who drop a tool at the
first hint of gossip, and afterwards return reluctantly to
the unfinished job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Te-he! There&#8217;ll be terrible pranksome doings when
David comes back,&#8221; said Billy, leaning on his hammer.
&#8220;He&#8217;s like the swallows in a manner of speaking, this
same man David&mdash;off for the winter, and home when
Garth has got nicely warmed up again. When will he be
coming, like? The first swallow&#8217;s nest I mind last year
began a-building when the ousel hatched out her clutch of
five up in Winnybrook Wood. Seems a long while to
wait,&#8221; he added, glancing at the ribbon of firelit snow
across the highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;twill soon pass. Time does for busy folk,&#8221;
said Hirst, warming his hands at the smithy fire and
thinking, with some compunction, of the daughter he had
left at Good Intent &#8220;to have her cry out, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was silent for awhile, his massiveness and air of
detachment from the world suggesting some impersonal
figure of destiny. Then suddenly, as his way was, he
returned to extreme childishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;David will be bringing a lile pipeful o&#8217; baccy; and,
if he can no way find a match, I&#8217;ve got the fire to light it
at right soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yeoman laughed, rattling the horseshoes on the
walls, and handed his pouch to Billy. When the clay pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
was loaded, and the quiet puffs of smoke were going up
to the blackened rafter-beams, Billy laughed foolishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems I&#8217;m in a terrible puzzlement, like a hen with
an addled egg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are ye, now, and why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, soon as ever David comes back wi&#8217; the swallows,
blessed if he won&#8217;t want a daft body to go working all at
bellows-blowing. Look at Dan Foster&#8217;s lad, and say by
yond same token if bellows-blowing isn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foster&#8217;s lad was wiping the sweat from his forehead, and
he grinned at them both with friendly acquiescence in
Billy&#8217;s logic.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s soon put right,&#8221; said Hirst &#8220;What&#8217;s work i&#8217;
winter, Billy, is play when spring comes in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fool smoked the matter over with tranquil disregard
of time. &#8220;I believe ye,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Have
watched the birds to some purpose, I. They&#8217;ll be hopping
i&#8217; search o&#8217; crumbs all winter-time, as lean as a bare-boughed
tree; but see &#8217;em in spring, wi&#8217; the gloss on their
wings, and their bonnie, bright eyes, and their calls when
they&#8217;re all by way o&#8217; mating, ye&#8217;d scarce know which was
work, or which play, to these same scatter wits. So David&#8217;s
coming swallow-fashion home, is he, to make me play at
bellows&#8217; blowing? I&#8217;ll be glad to see the man&#8217;s right,
proper face again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was still sitting by the hearth at Good Intent, and
was still thinking of David&#8217;s letter, of the postscript which
she understood so well. She was aware of a childish
wonder that the message should have reached her with all
its freshness after so long a sea voyage. The man&#8217;s unswerving
loyalty, his dumb acceptance of any treatment
she might give him, brought a pang of real suffering. She
had no weight of remorse to battle with, as Gaunt had
when he thought of the moorland grave; and yet, in spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
of logic, she blamed herself. Overstrung as she was
to-night, she could picture David&#8217;s return, the pathetic
hopefulness that his new power of talking about foreign
lands would bring him nearer to his desire, his ignorance
that there was any bond between herself and Reuben
Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then, there is none,&#8221; she would finish weakly, and
would find little comfort in the thought, and the tears
would fill her eyes once more, because David was so constant,
and she so weak to help him.</p>

<p>Cilla of the Good Intent stood in the middle of her own
winter-tide, just as Garth village did; and the spring,
as Billy had said, would seem long in coming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE&#8217;S no resisting Strathgarth Dale when her true
spring arrives. She has many ambushes, many a
sportive deceit, between winter and the breaking of the
leaf-buds. It will please her mood to let woodbine leaf
in March, to throw a wealth of saffron sunlight into sheltered
corners of the fields, so that a man may sit and bask,
and tell himself&mdash;knowing it a pleasant self-deceit,
if he be bred in Strathgarth&mdash;that spring this year is
coming early and is staying late. The next day a northwest
gale will bring sleet and snow with it. And so
through April&mdash;and half of May, perhaps&mdash;the weather
teases folk, till their tempers grow brittle, and they hint
darkly that it is a fool&#8217;s job to go on living in such
bleak lands.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the real spring comes, and the warm,
keen joy of it, the eagerness of nesting birds and growing
green-stuff, sweep memory of the winter&#8217;s bitterness away.
It is spring and summer in one, this wonder-season that
takes hold of Strathgarth Dale. The cattle, from sheer
lust of life and liberty, throw foolish heads abroad and
chase each other up and down the primrose pastures.
Stern men unbend, and frail people grow frolicsome.
It is sure, at this season of the leafing trees, that there&#8217;s
no place else in which to live save the long dale of Garth.</p>

<p>On one of these days Gaunt walked up to Ghyll Farm.
All up the fields the cowslips curtsied to him, or primroses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
ventured maidish glances from their nooks. The larks
rose high, and sang of courage and well-being. The
plovers moved sedately, two by two, about the fields, and
pretended, each pair of them, that the world did not know
them at sight for nesting mates. A score of unconsidered
flowers were budding eagerly.</p>

<p>Reuben found Widow Mathewson at the gate of the
croft, as if she looked for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I somehow fancied ye&#8217;d come, Reuben,&#8221; she said,
with as pleasant a glance of trust and welcome as though
she were forty years younger, and he a lover bustling
up with spring glamour in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was this way, mother. You told me your
man was to be off for a day&#8217;s holiday, and I thought there
might be an odd job here and there&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; put in the other, with a quiet laugh of content.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I knew ye&#8217;d be stepping up the
fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a good deal to be done, as it chanced, and
it was evening before all was finished. After they had
supped together, Mrs. Mathewson led Reuben out into
the croft and turned toward the moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might as well enjoy the cool o&#8217; the day, now we&#8217;ve
earned it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Reuben glanced at her inquiringly. Her voice was gentler
than he had known it; her shrewd grey eyes were soft
and kindly as they met his own. It seemed that spring
had touched her weather-beaten life with fingers light
and tender.</p>

<p>She was taking the track to Peggy&#8217;s grave, for all that;
and Gaunt wondered why she chose just this one way
to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I laugh often at you folk who live smothered down
in the valley yonder,&#8221; said the widow, turning for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
glance at the dipping moor, the green pastures, the hills
whose jagged tops were ruddy with the afterglow. &#8220;When
&#8217;tis cold, ye&#8217;re colder than us; when &#8217;tis hot, ye&#8217;ve never
a breath o&#8217; clean moor-air to cool ye. I&#8217;d have died o&#8217;
my troubles long since, Reuben, if it hadn&#8217;t been for the
moor.&#8221;</p>

<p>With curious tenderness, she pointed out to him the landmarks,
and named them all. Behind that spur of hill
lay Dene hamlet. Just under the pole-star, showing bright
green-blue in a strip of sky, stood the little farm where
she had lived as a lass when Mathewson came courting
her. The points of the compass were so many guides
to memory&mdash;to memory, which is all the old folk have
to warm them when spring calls up the pastures and demands
an answer to his insolent, young note.</p>

<p>She almost forgot her errand, in this love she had for
the moor and the encircling hills. There was a story
to tell of Heyward&#8217;s lass, who lived just where the pine
wood showed dark below them in the evening light; of
Daft Will, who lived under Sharprise yonder, and was the
wildest and friendliest squire who ever rode the Strathgarth
bridle-ways; of Bachelor Royd, who always said
that he&#8217;d never cared to buy a wife by flattery, because
pigs were easier come by and more profitable at the cost
of open bargain in the market.</p>

<p>And then she turned to him, still with the smile that
smoothed out so many furrows from her tired old face.
&#8220;All this is old wives&#8217; talk!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was allus
a lile bit daft, like poor Peggy, but it heartens me to talk
now and again o&#8217; days gone by. Maybe they&#8217;d their own
share o&#8217; crosses an&#8217; whimsies, yond old times, but they
have a trick o&#8217; smelling sweeter than the new days, Reuben.&#8221;</p>

<p>She grew silent when they reached the glen, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
peace did not leave her face. It was a pleasant bed,
she felt, they had made for Peggy here, now that the snow
and the east wind had gone, and the stream was free to
sing its litanies. The rowan was in its first leaf, rippling
under the least touch of the breeze; from the moor came
the strong, eager scent of ling and greening bilberry; above
them the stars showed one by one, while all along the
western rises a wisp of afterglow lay like a saffron mantle
over the sleepy hill-tops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben,&#8221; she said by and by, &#8220;I want to talk to ye,
and I fancied we could best find words up here. Ye&#8217;ll
need a mistress soon for Marshlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well as Gaunt knew her liking for abrupt, plain speech,
he was startled. His thoughts had been all of the past
year&#8217;s heedlessness and tragedy; he could not rid himself
of the figure that seemed to stand beside the grave&mdash;a
radiant ghost, with gipsy eyes and straight, lithe figure,
and a crimson kerchief knotted at the breast. There was
no looking forward, here where the wind and the sky
were quiet, and the still moor watched its dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not that look, Reuben!&#8221; said Mrs. Mathewson,
laying a gentle hand on his arm. &#8220;I never was one for
back reckonings. It&#8217;s all well enough, while the grief&#8217;s on
ye, to look behind; but there comes a time to look forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only last autumn she died, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so, but there&#8217;s been fire and torment for ye in
between&mdash;oh, I know, Reuben!&mdash;and the clock ticks
very slow at such times. Would ye listen once in a way
while I talk to ye? There&#8217;s decency i&#8217; grief; and, after
that, there&#8217;s a man&#8217;s need to look at the track ahead.
We&#8217;re here for this world&#8217;s business, Reuben, till we die.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking at her with a puzzled question in his
eyes, as if she had roused him from some nightmare and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
was telling him that the light of day was sweeping through
the windows of his prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that,&#8221; went on the other, &#8220;well, Peggy&#8217;s wiser
than me by now, for I&#8217;ve no notion o&#8217; what happens afterward.
We live on, I reckon; though Mathewson, being
fond o&#8217; sleep at all times, would have it that we never wake
up again. I used to tell him that I came of a wiry stock,
and knew we were meant, like, to live on&mdash;in some
sort o&#8217; heaven, maybe, seeing what a lot o&#8217; t&#8217; other place
we get i&#8217; this life.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something clean and vigorous, like a wind
from the heath, in this woman&#8217;s outlook on the life that
had harassed her, on the life that was to come. If her
faith lay deep and hard to find, her fearlessness and honesty
had in them the same massive power that underlay
Billy&#8217;s oddities.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Gaunt yielded to her mood. He had
spent himself generously to serve this late-found mother,
and it was her turn now to stretch a helping hand to him.</p>

<p>Out of the quiet night, the fragrant moor, there came
a quickened sense of motherhood to the woman. Spring
leads the younger folk down paths where the valleys
shelter primroses and nesting throstles; it leads the old
to the higher tracks where the sky and the moor-winds
talk of abnegation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben, my lad,&#8221; she said, her harsh voice softened
to the lilt of the heather-breeze, &#8220;Reuben, ye&#8217;re too full
o&#8217; life to live lonely for Peggy&#8217;s sake. There&#8217;s Marshlands,
too. Have ye never thought that ye needed a son
to follow you? Of course you have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Reuben answered gravely. &#8220;Yes, I had thought
of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mathewson was a weakly man enough, but
he never did forgive me for bringing a lile lass into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
world, instead of a lad; and I always sort o&#8217; respected
him for it, somehow. Stands to sense, Reuben; it&#8217;s the
man&#8217;s way to want a boy or two, to carry the old name
and the old house on. It&#8217;s i&#8217; the blood, and it goes
deeper than any kiss-i&#8217;-the-coppice love o&#8217; women. Oh,
I&#8217;m old, and I know, and I&#8217;m telling ye!&#8221; she finished,
relapsing into her favourite phrase.</p>

<p>There was pluck in this quiet persuasiveness of the
widow&#8217;s. She had been bitterly jealous on Peggy&#8217;s behalf,
though her girl was long past all feeling of the kind.
It had hurt her when now and then she had seen Gaunt
and Cilla together in Garth Street, or in the fields, and had
read their secret more plainly than they did themselves.
Only by hard endeavour, by grasping her love for Reuben,
and bringing her sturdy common sense to bear upon
his welfare, had she found courage for this talk at Peggy&#8217;s
graveside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she added, after a silence, &#8220;it was always
Miss Good Intent.&#8221; For the first time a touch of the old
bitterness was in her voice. &#8220;What did I tell ye long
ago, Reuben? Ye need a ladyish mistress for Marshlands,
&#8217;specially now ye&#8217;re bringing the place into its old
shape again. I&#8217;ll not complain, lad; and, as for Peggy,
she lies very quiet and willun&#8217;t speak a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must wait, mother, wait and see what happens
afterwards,&#8221; said Reuben gravely. &#8220;We&#8217;ll not talk of
it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bitterness left her, and she came nearer and laid
a hand on his arm. &#8220;Life doesn&#8217;t wait. &#8217;Tis only death
can spare time for that. Just tell yourself old scores are
settled handsomely, Reuben, and find yourself a mate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The starshine and the silence of the moor wrapped the
two of them about. The fever-heat of August, the misery
and fear, were softened, till they seemed, to Gaunt, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
not to the widow, part of a tragedy much further off in
point of time.</p>

<p>A peewit came straying down the moor, and wheeled
and cried about the rowan-tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark ye,&#8221; said Mrs. Mathewson, &#8220;there&#8217;s Peggy&#8217;s
parson come to say a prayer or two above her. He&#8217;s constant,
like, yond bird; she had him so tame, ye&#8217;ll mind,
that he&#8217;d eat from her hand, and he never went south
this winter, like most of his mates. He just comes drifting
down each night, like a lost bairn seeking home, and
says his prayers, and then goes lap-winging up the moor
again. There, we&#8217;ll be getting home, Reuben. &#8217;Tis a
grand night for two together, if they happen to be springtime-young;
but ye&#8217;re tired of an old woman&#8217;s chatter by
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the porch, Gaunt stooped and kissed
her awkwardly. Such tokens were rare between them,
and his feeling was always one of shyness, as if he feared
reproof.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been kind to me to-night, mother,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve a right to be. Take a breath o&#8217; common
sense down fro&#8217; the moor to the valley lands, and quit
thinking o&#8217; last year&#8217;s nests. Good night, Reuben.
I&#8217;m fancying lile Miss Cilla will not choose so far wide o&#8217;
the mark, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood at the porch-door long after he had gone.
She was jealous no longer on Peggy&#8217;s behalf. A great
weariness had come to her&mdash;tiredness of all things under
this warm, soft sky, with its stars and its silent peace.
She had paid her debt to Gaunt. Her knowledge of all
he had done for her, when none but he came up to help
her through the fever-time, had stood to Widow Mathewson
as a debt, and she had always had a liking for meeting
creditors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>Peggy lay under the rowan, with the quiet of the lapwing&#8217;s
evensong above her. Reuben was striding down
the fields, lusty and long to live. But this woman, standing
at the porch, was empty of all courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spring blows warm to the young,&#8221; was her thought.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis only right it should&mdash;but what of the old, sapless
folk?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed, and laughed at herself the next moment,
and answered her own question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so sapless, after all,&#8221; she said, in her brisk, tart
voice as she turned indoors. &#8220;There&#8217;s a farm to look
after, and a lazy farm-lad to get up betimes to-morrow&#8217;s
morn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt, meanwhile, had got down the fields as far as
the foot-bridge that decides a man whether he shall cross
to Garth, or turn to the right and seek the road which
leads Marshlands way. Gaunt chose the left-hand track,
over the slender arch of stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go by way o&#8217; Garth,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;The
longest way round is pleasant on a night like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The longest way round led him past Good Intent, and a
big voice sounded from the porch as he neared it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll have a rare fine day for your journey, Cilla,&#8221;
Hirst was saying, taking all the parish into his confidence,
though he thought his tone subdued. &#8220;I never saw a
likelier sundown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt stopped. A senseless lover&#8217;s dread had seized
him. Cilla going a journey? Had his hopes been all
so much idleness? A journey meant travelling overseas,
surely&mdash;and David was in Canada&mdash;and there had
always been a friendship between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father,&#8221; he heard Cilla answer. &#8220;You always
did say I had luck o&#8217; the weather when I took a journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt moved forward. The girl&#8217;s tone was so quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
happy that he was sure now of his hasty guess. David
was on his way home, so he had understood; but
perhaps he had changed his mind at the last moment,
had found a profitable farm out yonder, and Cilla was
going out to him. He remembered her longing, a year
ago, to see what lay beyond Garth hills; it was bitter
to recall how eagerly he had prompted her restlessness,
had talked of other countries until at last he caught her
fancy. And now she was going out to marry David,
and it would be the slow-going smith who showed her
the strange lands.</p>

<p>The dim, white roads seemed to be slipping away from
under Gaunt&#8217;s feet. He no longer wished to stay for
a chat at Good Intent; his one desire was to get away with
his misery, and conquer it as best he might.</p>

<p>The yeoman checked him. He and Cilla were sitting
on the stone bench just inside the porch, as they had sat
for the last hour. It was dusk along the highway, but
the porch was darker still, and Hirst, looking out from
its shelter, could not mistake the figure striding by so
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have we done, then, Mr. Gaunt that you&#8217;re i&#8217;
such a hurry to get past the door?&#8221; roared Hirst.</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed, with a constraint that puzzled Cilla.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve called so often lately that I fancied my welcome
might be overstayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear him, Cilla! As though every man in the dales
didn&#8217;t know our ways. There&#8217;s two sort o&#8217; folk, Mr.
Gaunt. One sort would never set foot on my doorstep,
if I could help it. T&#8217; other sort can come dawn, or dusk,
or middle day, and as often as they please. Now, step
forrard, Cilla; we&#8217;ve been idling i&#8217; the dark here long
enough. Light up indoors, lass, and stir the peats, and set
a couple o&#8217; glasses out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>When they followed Cilla in, and stood in the lamp-glow,
Reuben looked across at her. &#8220;You are going a journey
to-morrow?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>She did not meet his glance, but stooped to play with
the kitten on the hearth. He saw the delicate colour
come and go across her cheeks, as it did always when her
feelings were touched in any way; and again he guessed
that David was the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I am going&mdash;to Keta&#8217;s Well,&#8221; she finished
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>One little, upward look she gave him, then went on
playing with the kitten. The glance was so full of question,
so quiet and yet so near to roguishness, that it
bewildered Gaunt. Gradually he felt the ground grow
firm under his feet again, as he realized that it was not
David, after all, who had tempted her to make a journey.
And suddenly he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, durned if I know why you&#8217;re laughing,&#8221;
said Hirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla tells ye she&#8217;s going up to Keta&#8217;s Well, as she
goes every spring, to do a few lile oddments o&#8217; business for
me; and ye seem to fancy it a jest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; said Reuben, &#8220;the best I&#8217;ve heard for many
a day. It was the notion of Miss Cilla doing business for
ye that tickled me, somehow,&#8221; he added hurriedly, seeing
the yeoman&#8217;s half puzzled, half quizzical glance at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis spring has gone to your head, my lad. That&#8217;s
what &#8217;tis. I was like that myself when I was your age.
I could laugh at th&#8217; first idle thought, or at none at all,
soon as ever I heard the cock-throstle whistling to the hen-bird,
or saw the first o&#8217; the green dappling every hedgerow.
Eh, lad,&#8221; he broke off, reaching for his pipe, &#8220;I&#8217;d
swop my time o&#8217; life for yours, if you&#8217;d let me. But,
then, ye wouldn&#8217;t. Ye&#8217;re no fool, eh?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>When Reuben said good night, no whisper passed between
Cilla and himself; but she set out the old, mended
lilac frock before she got to bed, and smoothed the folds
as if it were a living thing, dear to her from old acquaintance.
In her heart she knew that Gaunt would see it
on the morrow.</p>

<p>The dawn, when it came cool and fragrant through her
open window, found Cilla half awake already. She had
dreamed of Ghyll Farm, of fever and penance and disaster;
it was good to wake to this clean, real life that
called to her from out-of-doors.</p>

<p>She did her work about the house, gave Yeoman Hirst
his breakfast, then went up to don the lilac gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bonnie to be good,&#8221; said Widow Lister, as she
watched Cilla pass her door a half-hour later. &#8220;When
we&#8217;re made for sorrow, and should be humble-like i&#8217;
face o&#8217; death to come, &#8217;tis tempting Providence to wear
such a becoming shade o&#8217; lilac.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla went down the street, radiant, like the spring,
with some happiness that came from within. She was
eager, buoyant, and she moved along the grey, old highroad
like some tall fairy who had forgotten that the world
was tired and humdrum.</p>

<p>Will the Driver came rattling up to the Elm Tree Inn
with his team of three, and greeted Cilla with the pleasant
air of welcome that she commanded at all times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, but ye&#8217;ve a trick o&#8217; tempting spring out from
frosty corners,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll be for Keta&#8217;s Well?
I always did say there&#8217;s one day o&#8217; spring that&#8217;s better
than the rest, and that&#8217;s when I carry Miss Good Intent
for a passenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of the bustle attending Garth&#8217;s busiest
moment of the day, while mail-bags were being exchanged,
with the gravity befitting an affair of Her Majesty&#8217;s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
while parcels were being handed up and down between
Will and the chattering knot of folk, Reuben Gaunt came
swinging down the street.</p>

<p>Last year he had ridden in; but to-day he was on foot,
and he clambered up to the empty seat at Cilla&#8217;s side
as if it were reserved for him. She turned shyly to him
as soon as Garth was left behind and the white, sunlit
riband of the highway stretched in front of them. &#8220;You&mdash;you
did not say last night that you had business, too,
at Keta&#8217;s Well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same business that brought me here a year ago,&#8221;
he answered soberly. &#8220;There&#8217;s some property I want
to own&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla was looking ahead and his tone misled her.
&#8220;Surely you have property enough? Marshlands, father
always says, is just the right size&mdash;big enough to keep a
man busy all day and every day, and small enough to
walk around it when he finds an idle morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes. &#8217;Tis a case of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard, maybe.
At any rate, I shall never care much for Marshlands, unless
I get this other property to round it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in his tone made her glance quickly at him,
and it was hard to believe that a year of upward struggle
lay between the old Reuben and the new. His face was
full of boyish mischief. He looked as if he had known
never a care in the world, but had lived always in this
warmth of the spendthrift, teeming spring. She understood
him better in that moment, understood how easy
it had been to name him &#8220;running-water,&#8221; because they
had given him never a chance, until last year, of proving
his mettle. He had proved himself, once for all, and
now was a boy again until the next summons came.</p>

<p>Cilla let her own mood run with his. She knew his
meaning now, and would not look at him, and could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
trust herself to speak, but the white road, and the green,
homely pastures, and the birds that fluttered up the hedge-sides
in front of the rattling coach, led out, she knew,
to the enchanted lands &#8220;beyond Garth hills.&#8221; They
lay nearer home, these lands, than Cilla of the Good Intent
had guessed.</p>

<p>They were passing Widow Fletcher&#8217;s now, and Will the
Driver turned in his seat as they went by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am having a holiday, I, Mr. Gaunt,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t say I&#8217;m glad, for it wouldn&#8217;t be seemly; and
I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m grieved, for it wouldn&#8217;t be true; but the
widow, she broke an ankle in trying to catch me up a week
ago, just when I&#8217;d dodged her for once. Widows are
trials, I own, and maybe t&#8217; other lile woman at Garth&mdash;her
sister&mdash;may be laid by for awhile with a sprain, or
a touch o&#8217; rheumatiz, or what not. There&#8217;s always hope,
as the fox said, when he was leaving his tail in the keeper&#8217;s
trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt laughed in answer, and passed the banter which
was true coinage here on the open highway; but Cilla,
stealing a glance at him, saw that the grave look had returned.
He was thinking of a widow up at Ghyll yonder,
who had met life from another, and a braver standpoint.</p>

<p>She, too, felt that a chill had touched the warmth and
glamour of this drive to Keta&#8217;s Well, as if the breeze
had shifted suddenly from west to east. She remembered
the pool where Mrs. Mathewson and she had met while
rescuing sheep from April snow, recalled the struggle
between Reuben and Billy, and the widow&#8217;s tale of what
had happened long ago at Marshlands. The tale had
recurred to her many times during these past weeks, and
with it a distrust of Reuben against which she struggled
loyally.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>&#8220;What are ye thinking of?&#8221; he asked, breaking a
long silence.</p>

<p>Cilla knew that this distrust would lie between them
always, if she did not answer frankly. She was glad he
had given her so plain an opening. Hard as it was to
speak, it would be harder afterwards, if she let the chance
go by; and Cilla was never one to let the bigger evil come,
for lack of courage to meet the lesser.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of Billy, and a story I did not want
to hear. Reuben, why do you always pass poor Billy
as if he were nothing to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gives me little chance to do anything else,&#8221; said
Gaunt, reddening as he met the quiet, questioning glance
that would not be denied. &#8220;He hates me for some reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he knows&mdash;it is hard to tell what the poor
lad understands, behind all that foolishness of his&mdash;perhaps
he knows he&#8217;s your half-brother, and that you&#8217;ve
denied it time and time again. &#8217;Tis your denial troubles
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla could be merciless when there was need to reach
the truth. She would not let his glance waver; she compelled
him to be honest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cilla,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I <i>had</i> to deny it. I&#8217;ll own
to my own shame at any time, but not to my father&#8217;s.
He may have been this or that, my father; but I&#8217;ll lie
any day to keep what good name I can for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will the Driver turned again, and pointed up the fells
with his whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always liked to see the deer, Miss Cilla,&#8221; he
broke in. The wind of his own fast driving had carried
their talk behind him, and he did not know how welcome
was the interruption. &#8220;They&#8217;re browsing yonder near the
fell-tops, just to the right o&#8217; the spinney; d&#8217;ye see them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>Cilla sought for the brown specks, far up the pastures
that stepped boldly to the sky. These specks of brown
stood for the pride of bygone overlords of Strathgarth, in
the days when their deer forest stretched out from Shepston
to Keta&#8217;s Well, and a league or two beyond. And
Will, whose forefolk, like himself, had lived within the
limits of Garth&#8217;s hills, was proud of their diminished forest&#8217;s
splendour.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old stag&#8217;s fair riotous, so the keeper tells me,&#8221;
went on Will. &#8220;He&#8217;s tame as a cushat the rest o&#8217; the
year, and will feed fro&#8217; your hand; but soon as ever spring
comes in, bless me, and saving your presence, Miss Cilla,
he&#8217;s the devil and all with his nasty temper. Gee-up,
Captain! We&#8217;re late,&#8221; he added, laying a gentle lash
across the leader. &#8220;We&#8217;re always late, what with this
constant plague o&#8217; widows on the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla leaned forward, her face between her hands, and
watched the road slip past the hedgerows. This man beside
her, of all men in the world, had humbled her. He had
gone willingly into a house of fever; he, the acknowledged
wastrel of the parish, had put his back into the work of
making Marshlands what it should be, and had changed
the stubborn outlook of his neighbours from dislike to
growing friendliness. That was much; but the confession
she had wrung from him meant more to this girl
whose sense of honour was clean and dainty as an April
day. The father had done ill with his own life, and
with his son&#8217;s; yet Reuben had striven to keep what
starveling flowers he could in bloom about the old man&#8217;s
grave.</p>

<p>Gaunt waited till she chose to break the silence. He had
learned patience last August, as he had learned strength,
while he waited on the sun-scorched uplands to know if
Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s would live or die. He had learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
further patience while nursing a half-ruined property
into new health.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cilla turned to him, and his heart beat faster
than ever it had done while winning the great race at
Linsall Fair. All that the spring day held of tenderness,
of trust and hope and love of life for living&#8217;s sake, seemed
gathered into Cilla&#8217;s glance. He had won his biggest race
of all.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get down here, Will,&#8221; he said by and by, as they
neared the old green lane that led back to Garth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought ye were bound for Keta&#8217;s Well,&#8221; said the
driver, with the dalesman&#8217;s frank curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we were; but we&#8217;ve changed our minds.&#8221; Gaunt&#8217;s
laugh was a boy&#8217;s again. He seemed not to care how soon
all Strathgarth knew the meaning of the glance that Cilla
had given him. &#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten the old saying, Will;
folk are free to change their minds i&#8217; the spring, like the
weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cilla did not question, but took his hand and slipped
lightly to the highway. At another time her father&#8217;s business
up at Keta&#8217;s Well would have been all-important;
but to-day she had forgotten it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; muttered Will, as he drove forward between
the lusty hedgerows. &#8220;Just a year since last I carried
the lile fools as far as Keta&#8217;s Well. &#8217;Tis a long while,
seeing a babby could have told the two o&#8217; them what ailed
them. Well, I&#8217;m not complaining. If Miss Good Intent
is half as bonnie wedded as she is single, there&#8217;s none of
us need grumble. Gee-up, Captain! Her Majesty will
put up with a lot, but she gets terrible cross if we&#8217;re late
with her mails. Gee-up, lad, or shall I make ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaunt had opened the gate, and Cilla and he were loitering
down the lane which once had been the highway, but
which now was grazed by sheep and cattle. There was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
curious privacy about this abandoned road, a charm
which haunts neglected thoroughfares. The raking
fells lay white against the sky on one hand; on the
other lambs bleated to their mothers in the sheltered
hollows. The birds could not be quiet, and a happy
din went up into the sunshine and the warmth. The lark
sang &#8220;like as if he&#8217;d burst his lile throat all to pieces,&#8221;
as Billy put it, and the throstle piped, high and clear,
as if he meant to be obeyed, and the curlews were dipping
and wailing, wailing and dipping, with their note of
everlasting sorrow.</p>

<p>A hare got up from under their feet. A squirrel peeped
at them from the bough of a leafing sycamore. Men had
been busy once along this green, neglected lane; and the
fret of their tired feet had passed, and the mother of us
all had chosen this for her quiet house, where birds might
nest, and flowers could bloom, and men&#8217;s insolence was
hidden out of sight.</p>

<p>If ever two folk were given the one right day and the
one right place for wooing, Gaunt and Cilla were favoured
now. The peace of the lane, the eagerness of all the
teeming life about them, the very fell-tops, pointing with
white fingers to the blue and happy sky, seemed made for
them; and Cilla was proving once again the truth of the
Garth saying that &#8220;Miss Good Intent could always have
the Queen&#8217;s weather for the asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>A year ago they had trodden the same lane as boy and
girl, had kissed, and fancied life held nothing better.
They had seen life face to face since then, had lived
through long, ugly days that seemed too sordid for romance;
yet here was the glamour, walking step by step
with them, a glamour that was built, not on the sands of
fancy, but on foundations sure as those of the sturdy
hills about them. Gaunt turned to look at Cilla. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
was dainty in her lilac frock. Any man, passing her,
would have halted for a second glance at this lass whom
Strathgarth summers had treated kindly, whom Strathgarth
winters had given a reliance unknown to folk bred
amid softer climates. He scarcely knew the face of which
he had dreamed of nights; its peace, and its tender,
eager beauty, were borrowed from all that lay beyond
Garth hills, and from all that lay within them.</p>

<p>They came to the bend of the lane where last year they
had met Peggy o&#8217; Mathewson&#8217;s, and Cilla halted for a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Peggy,&#8221; she murmured, generous and warm of
sympathy as this day of spring that set the world to
rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was never meant to be,&#8221; said Reuben, with no
assurance in his tone, but rather like a child who gropes
helplessly for the answer to a riddle.</p>

<p>And Cilla smiled through her tears. &#8220;My dear, it was
never meant to be. Reuben, there&#8217;s a lile bird singing at
my heart. I can&#8217;t mistake the song.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder they called it Fairy&#8217;s Lane,&#8221; said Reuben.
&#8220;I used to laugh at the notion once.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DAVID the Smith had chosen this same day of spring
for his return to Garth, though he had sent no word
of his coming to Yeoman Hirst. He remembered the
boisterous good-will shown him when he left the old
haunts to cross overseas. Because he returned the same
single-hearted David who had loved Garth village from
his babyhood, he was shy of such another welcome at his
home-coming. He would not take the mail from Shepston,
the mail which carried Gaunt and Cilla to their
betrothal, but walked instead.</p>

<p>He wanted to see the daffodils in bloom, in the crofts
and the wayside gardens that bordered the highroad.
He wanted to be free of chatter, and to feel his two legs
carrying him, as a man&#8217;s legs should, between the grey,
remembered hills. He wanted, most of all, to find Cilla
of the Good Intent at home, and to tempt her&mdash;God&#8217;s
pity on the man&#8217;s brave simplicity&mdash;with tales of other
lands.</p>

<p>At four of the afternoon he came to Garth, and shied,
from old habit, when Widow Lister pattered out to meet
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see ye again, David,&#8221; she said, coquetting,
as she always did, with a hale and well-to-look-at man.
&#8220;Bless me, what a power o&#8217; heat there must be, yonder
over Garth hills. Ye&#8217;re freckled and tanned, David.
&#8217;Tis good to look at a face like yours; puts one i&#8217; mind
o&#8217; sun and hay harvest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m well enough; but &#8217;tis Garth for me, I reckon,
till I&#8217;m taken to the kirkyard, and may be afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow&#8217;s face lengthened, from habit, into grave,
forbidding lines. &#8220;Afterwards is as ye&#8217;ve done i&#8217; this
life, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said David, cheerily. &#8220;I&#8217;m content to rest
on that standby, Widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for awhile, daunted by a strength that was
rooted deeper than her shallow soil would ever know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your aunt Joanna has no such fear o&#8217; the after life,&#8221;
she said, with sudden triumph. &#8220;She borrowed a tin
kettle fro&#8217; me, did Joanna, and she forgot to return it,
like, when she married into a heathen land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, she&#8217;s good at forgetting. But see ye, Widow, I
didn&#8217;t come all this way to talk o&#8217; tin kettles. I came
to see bonnie Garth, with her face new-washed for spring
and all the posies out i&#8217; the garden-strips.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a good-humoured nod he moved on to Good Intent,
and found the yeoman leaning over the gate of the
seven acre field, watching his lambs with that peculiar air
of leisure and detachment from all worry which comes to
farmers in and between the bustle of these warm, full-blooded
days of spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have your ewes done well, then?&#8221; asked David,
as quietly as if he had seen Hirst every day during the
past months.</p>

<p>The yeoman turned with a start. &#8220;David! Now, ye
startled me, I own. I was just thinking o&#8217; ye, and reckoning
&#8217;twould be all about time for ye to be taking shipboard
home; and then your voice came sudden-like; and
I fancied it must be your ghost, come to tell us you were
drowned at sea. There&#8217;s the daft fool I&#8217;ve grown,
David, since you left Garth!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much ghost about me,&#8221; laughed David,
as he gripped the other&#8217;s hand with old-time strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, if a grip like a pair o&#8217; pincers be aught to
go by. Stand ye there, David, and let me take a square
look at ye. I&#8217;ve never been better pleased to see a man
i&#8217; my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked around his friend, as if he were a specimen
of farm stock whose points he was anxious to appraise
correctly. Then he gave a great roar of approbation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought spring was treating me well when the ewes
twinned so grandly, and scarce a lamb lost; but there
was better to come, &#8217;twould seem. David, ye&#8217;ll have to
stay i&#8217; Garth. &#8217;Tis a different place without ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>David looked around him&mdash;at the pastures, full of the
music of lambing-time, at the rough-built walls that traced
a grey, irregular pattern across the green face of the land,
at the spinneys and outlying barns which were so many
landmarks to remembrance. Then he leaned his arms on
the gate, and gave a quiet laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m here to stay,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The months have
been years to me out yonder. It will take a lot to &#8217;tice
me out o&#8217; Strathgarth Dale again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So what of all those traveller&#8217;s tales ye promised
Cilla? I tell ye, David, she looks for livelier doings than
ever she saw at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve tales enough, maybe. &#8217;Tis a different life,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But naught so much to brag of?&#8221; put in Hirst
&#8220;There! That&#8217;s just what I always said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The life&#8217;s well enough for those it suits, but it&#8217;s over-young
for me.&#8221; David picked up a straw and chewed
it with a pleasant sense of leisure. &#8220;&#8217;Tis this way, if
I can get my tongue round a plain meaning. I&#8217;m ready
to do a day&#8217;s work with any man; but, when it&#8217;s done, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
like old things about me, th&#8217; old grindstone at the corner,
Widow Lister&#8217;s bit of a garden-front, with its daisies, and
London pride, and lile clumps o&#8217; primroses. I want to
be near all that my father loved, and his father afore him
and back to Flodden Field, or near thereby. Out yonder
&#8217;tis naught but looking forrard and hurrying. They&#8217;ll
come to our way o&#8217; thinking by and by, when their roots
have taken deeper hold; and they&#8217;ll do more work i&#8217; the
year, though they tell ye otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the David who had left the homeland. Unwavering
in his love for Strathgarth, quick to realize
a new phase of life, yet slow to accept it, he returned unspoiled,
a little surer of his faith, if that could be, in the
righteousness of older lands and older way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your aunt Joanna didn&#8217;t treat ye very well,&#8221; said
Hirst, after one of the pleasant silences that long ago had
helped to make the two men friends. &#8220;It puzzles me
that ye bear no malice, like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s as God made her, like all of us. There&#8217;s lile
use in going against handiwork o&#8217; that sort. She asked
me to go, and I went; and, when she hadn&#8217;t a use for me,
I came back.&#8221; He stooped to pick a fresh straw, and
again laughed gently. &#8220;&#8217;Tis as simple as falling out of
a tree, and no back reckonings either way, now I&#8217;m free
to live i&#8217; Garth again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst was not given to intuition. He thanked his
Maker every Sabbath for the past week&#8217;s mercies, and
tended his flocks with cheery zeal throughout the next
six days; but insight into the hidden workings of a man&#8217;s
character was rare with him.</p>

<p>He looked at David now&mdash;David, whose eyes were
blue and honest as the sky that roved over the sloping
fields, the rounded hills&mdash;and was compelled to understand
his comrade. He knew now why Cilla had liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
David well, but could not marry him. The &#8220;far&#8221;
look in David&#8217;s eyes was that which nature&#8217;s priests wear&mdash;the
look that Billy the Fool carried when he watched
a pair of nesting throstles&mdash;the look of the folk who are
content to watch life&#8217;s business, and to help it forward
whenever a chance for kindliness meets them at the road
corner.</p>

<p>Again the friendly silence fell between them. David
returned to mother earth again, and his voice had a wholesome
snap in it. &#8220;What is Gaunt o&#8217; Marshlands doing
these days? Running still to waste like water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no. He&#8217;s found running water has its uses in
a thin-soil country, and is tilling his lands with it instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaunt tilling his lands? Cuckoo&#8217;s eggs will be hatching
throstles next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you said folk were as God made &#8217;em,&#8221; said
Hirst, with a touch of sharpness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, but Gaunt&#8217;s as he made himself. I can&#8217;t abide
the man, and never could.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Hirst, to his own surprise, found himself defending
Reuben. He spoke warmly of his fearlessness at Ghyll,
of his plucky fight to win back a good name for his house.
Not until met by this dogged opposition of David&#8217;s, had
the yeoman guessed how well he had grown to like
Gaunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let bygones be bygones,&#8221; he finished. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not
like ye, David, to keep up a grudge like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;tis not like me, and I never felt it for another
man; and I won&#8217;t say I&#8217;m proud o&#8217; the feeling. But
there it is, and there it will have to bide a while longer,
seeing I can&#8217;t get rid on&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst, like a wise man, guessed that Cilla was the cause
of the ill-feeling, and talked no more of Reuben. He
chatted of Garth&#8217;s doings through the winter, led David<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
on to talk of his adventures; but all the while he noted a
growing restlessness in his companion. David kept glancing
down toward the farm, then up at the pastures, as if
in great fear or hope of some intrusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s not at home,&#8221; said Hirst, with a sly roar
of laughter. &#8220;The lile lass is faring out at Keta&#8217;s
Well.&#8221;</p>

<p>David looked shyly at the yeoman, surprised that his
secret had been guessed so easily. Then a great loneliness
took hold of him, an instinct of trouble and foreboding.
He had come straight to Good Intent, not pausing even
for a visit to his forge; and there had been one picture
in his mind. He would find Cilla, wearing the lilac
gown, at the farm. He would see a new light in her eyes
after the long absence and the unexpected return. He
would find readier speech than of old.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve travelled so far,&#8221; he said, more to himself than
to Hirst; &#8220;and she&#8217;s a stay-at-home most days o&#8217; the
year, and I fancied she&#8217;d be about the place just this one
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tuts! She&#8217;ll be back i&#8217; a few hours&#8217; time, David.
No need to go thinking the end o&#8217; the world is coming
because a lass is doing some bits o&#8217; business for her
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hirst, with all his cheeriness, was ill at ease. He knew
that this man&#8217;s dream would not come true; he felt that
a hint in time would be kindly, and yet he shrank from
giving pain. In his indecision he turned slowly down the
croft, and David followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s Cilla&#8217;s voice!&#8221; cried the yeoman, halting
suddenly. &#8220;She&#8217;s home before her time; and how
she&#8217;s managed it beats me, for the mail isn&#8217;t due for an
hour yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>And David watched the white highway below, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
it came out of the shelter of the trees and curved past Good
Intent. He felt sick and helpless.</p>

<p>Then he saw her, for the first time in the months that
had seemed years in passing. Gaunt and she stepped into
the road, as if they owned it and the whole, round world
besides. She was wearing the lilac gown, but it had not
been donned for David the Smith. They passed out of
sight toward the porch of Good Intent; and, because
they were looking at each other, they did not see the two
men in the croft above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got your wish,&#8221; said Hirst, bewildered
by the misery in David&#8217;s face, and trying still to believe
in his old creed that all would yet go well with everybody.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll step down, David, lad, and Cilla shall give you
tea of her own brewing, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye,&#8221; said David heavily, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll be getting
down to the forge. That&#8217;s where my heart will have to
bide from now on, and I might as well make a beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The yeoman watched him go. &#8220;Oh, bless me,&#8221; he
muttered ruefully, &#8220;I do like to see things go right for all.
Pity I hadn&#8217;t two lile Cillas, i&#8217;stead o&#8217; one, if David&#8217;s bent
on breaking his heart like any raw young lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>A busy hum sounded from the forge as David neared it.
Not many weeks ago the fire-glow had lain across the
road, a crimson splash on the white April snow; now it
fought for mastery with the clear, hot sunlight. David
lifted his head when he heard the rhythmical song of the
bellows, as an old fox-hound rouses himself when music of
the pack sounds down the wind. The blow had fallen
on him mercilessly; but already he felt heartened a little,
a very little, by the sturdy light of the forge. He stepped
to the doorway, and looked in. Dan Foster&#8217;s lad was
working the bellows, and Billy was playing at smithy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
work. David watched the man&#8217;s muscles tighten and
relax, relax and tighten, as he plied his hammer; and an
off thought came to him that the world&#8217;s work would be
better done if more folk played as Billy did.</p>

<p>Billy paused at last to wipe the sweat from his forehead,
and turned, and saw David standing in the doorway.
There was no surprise in his face. He was content to
play through the long winter, until the swallows came to
build their nests again in Garth. He knew they would
return, and waited patiently; for Billy, as all Garth knew,
&#8220;was not wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First o&#8217; the swallows came yesterday, David,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and blessed if ye haven&#8217;t followed, quick as ye could
scramble. &#8217;Tis good to see ye both.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was sore at heart. If he had been a woman, he
would have leaned against the smithy wall and sobbed
himself into a makeshift peace. As it was, he sought
about for some trivial help in need. He found the help
in that quiet, persistent thought of others which, perhaps,
had lost him Cilla; the wise were apt to think him dull.</p>

<p>He took a pouch from his pocket, and handed it to
Billy. When the black clay pipe was charged, he passed
a match across. It pleased him to see Billy light it
tranquilly upon the anvil, pleased him to watch the slow
wreaths of smoke curl among the rafters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your &#8217;baccy always smoked a lile thought sweeter
than other folk&#8217;s,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>In some muddled way, David understood that the welcome
he had looked for, here in Garth, came from this
massive, tranquil man whose power of speech was hindered.
The warm air of the forge, the smell of it, soothed
the fierce pain of David&#8217;s loss.</p>

<p>Billy the Fool laughed unexpectedly; it was his privilege.
He had caught sight of Dan Foster&#8217;s lad, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
idle by the bellows with a look of wonderment about his
cherry-red face.</p>

<p>&#8220;A queer lad, he,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;He&#8217;s been working ever
since you left, he has, while this same fool has had all
the fun. &#8217;Tis a terrible pranksome matter, this hammering
horseshoes into shape. Ye take a bit o&#8217; hard iron, and
it says it will no way budge, however hard ye hit it; and
ye say it shall budge; and then it gets into a fearful rage,
and spits at ye with its lile, red sparks; and ye go on hammering,
just for frolic, like, till bless me, if there hasn&#8217;t
a horseshoe grown out o&#8217; yond same bit of iron, like a
sycamore-leaf fro&#8217; the bud.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smith had lit his own pipe, and was listening with
something of the old content to Billy&#8217;s familiar line of
thought. All the fool&#8217;s interest in life, trace it deep
enough, centred round growth of some kind. It might
be growth of the plants under sheltered banks, that caught
the first footsteps of the spring, which claimed attention
from him; it might be the mother-work of birds when
they hatched their eggs in the many nests he over-watched,
or the whitening of the pastures when ewes began to drop
their lambs; it might be the forging of an iron rail, or the
building of a wall; but the instinct at the root of all his
pleasures was growth. Untrammelled, as no other man in
Garth was, by the frets and small indignities of daily
life, Billy had learned insight into the deeper truths. He
could write no verses, nor wished to; but he moved through
the quiet village life, for all that, a great poet, not of his
own dales only, but of the world.</p>

<p>David&#8217;s nature was akin to his in many ways, and at
times such as this, when Billy let his heart peep out and
showed why toil was play to him, the smith was apt to
feel a touch of awe, as if he listened to a greater than himself
who was talking of eternal verities. The next moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
Billy would lose his high, abstracted look, and would return
to some foolish detail of the world about him. He
did so now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve your money all ready for ye, David,&#8221; he said,
going to the far corner of the smithy and reaching down
a small, square box from the shelf. &#8220;Made the box myself,
soon as ever ye left Garth, and made a slit, I did, big
enough for money to go through, but not for fingers.
Te-he, David! Not for fingers, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was puzzled as the other jingled the coins as he
crossed the floor, and placed his money-box in the smith&#8217;s
hands. &#8220;What is all this, Billy?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play money,&#8221; said the fool impassively. &#8220;Ye see,
David, I&#8217;ve no more use for coins than for pebbles i&#8217; a
stream, so I saved &#8217;em up against your home-coming.
Charged terrible high prices, I, for shoeing a horse; and
folk laughed, and they paid it, they did, because &#8217;twas
only Fool Billy; and there&#8217;ll be a right proper nest-egg
ready for ye, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears were in David&#8217;s eyes at last. He had gone
on a wasted errand to another land, and had returned
empty of thanks and pocket; he had come cheerily home,
ready to start afresh with strong hands and a clean conscience
as his only capital, and had encountered Widow
Lister and her anxiety touching a tin kettle borrowed years
ago. He had looked down from Hirst&#8217;s croft at a strip
of sunlit highroad, and had seen a pair of lovers, full of
spring&#8217;s tender insolence and right-of-way. All had
slipped from under his feet, all save Billy the Fool, whose
pleasure, like his own, was to give&mdash;always to give, asking
no return, claiming only a pipeful of tobacco at the
day&#8217;s end, and a tranquil smoke over the morrow&#8217;s gifts
to other folk.</p>

<p>David passed a hand across his eyes, and moved to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
anvil, and took up the hammer. &#8220;Ye can run home, lile
lad,&#8221; he said, turning to Dan Foster&#8217;s lad. &#8220;Stay, here&#8217;s
a sixpence for ye to spend on yourself. Billy, &#8217;tis work
and play again, as i&#8217; the old days. Just bend your back
to the bellows.&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
